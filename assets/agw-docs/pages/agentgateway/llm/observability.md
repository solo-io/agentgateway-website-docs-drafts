## Before you begin

Complete an LLM guide, such as an [LLM provider-specific guide]({{< link-hextra path="/integrations/llm/providers/" >}}). This guide sends a request to the LLM and receives a response. You can use this request and response example to verify metrics and logs.  

## View LLM metrics

You can access the {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} metrics endpoint to view LLM-specific metrics, such as the number of tokens that you used during a request or response. 

1. Port-forward the agentgateway proxy on port 15020. 
   ```sh
   kubectl port-forward deployment/agentgateway-proxy -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} 15020  
   ```
2. Open the {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} [metrics endpoint](http://localhost:15020/metrics). 
3. Look for the `agentgateway_gen_ai_client_token_usage` metric. This metric is a [histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram) and includes important information about the request and the response from the LLM, such as:
   * `gen_ai_token_type`: Whether this metric is about a request (`input`) or response (`output`). 
   * `gen_ai_operation_name`: The name of the operation that was performed. 
   * `gen_ai_system`: The LLM provider that was used for the request/response. 
   * `gen_ai_request_model`: The model that was used for the request. 
   * `gen_ai_response_model`: The model that was used for the response. 
   

For more information, see the [Semantic conventions for generative AI metrics](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/gen-ai-metrics/) in the OpenTelemetry docs.

## Token usage fields {#token-usage-fields}

LLM providers disagree about whether the input token count in a response includes the tokens that the provider read from or wrote to its prompt cache. {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway-capital.md" >}} normalizes the counts, so that a field means the same thing no matter which provider served the request.

| Field | What it reports |
|-------|-----------------|
| `llm.inputTokens` | The total input count, including cache-read and cache-creation tokens. |{{< version exclude-if="1.0.x,1.1.x,1.2.x,1.3.x,1.4.x,1.5.x,1.6.x,2.2.x" >}}
| `llm.outputTokens` | The normalized output count, including reasoning tokens when the provider reports them separately. |{{< /version >}}
| `llm.totalTokens` | The normalized input count plus the output count. |
| `llm.providerInputTokens` | The input count exactly as the provider sent it. |
| `llm.providerTotalTokens` | The total count exactly as the provider sent it. |
| `llm.cachedInputTokens` | The input tokens that the provider read from cache. |
| `llm.cacheCreationInputTokens` | The input tokens that the provider wrote to cache. |

The `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` log and span field and the `input` series of the `agentgateway_gen_ai_client_token_usage` metric both report the normalized count.

{{< version exclude-if="1.0.x,1.1.x,1.2.x,1.3.x,1.4.x,1.5.x,1.6.x,2.2.x" >}}
The `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens` log and span field and the `output` series of the `agentgateway_gen_ai_client_token_usage` metric report the normalized output count.
{{< /version >}}

Anthropic and Amazon Bedrock exclude cached tokens from the input count that they report. OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Google Gemini include them. For the providers that exclude them, `llm.inputTokens` is therefore larger than `llm.providerInputTokens` whenever prompt caching is active. To report exactly what the provider billed, read `llm.providerInputTokens` or `llm.providerTotalTokens` instead.

{{< version exclude-if="1.0.x,1.1.x,1.2.x,1.3.x,1.4.x,1.5.x,1.6.x,2.2.x" >}}
Google Gemini can report reasoning tokens separately from completion tokens. For Gemini responses, `llm.outputTokens` includes visible output and reasoning tokens. As a result, the output count matches the output side of the provider's total token count.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not add `llm.cachedInputTokens` or `llm.cacheCreationInputTokens` to `llm.inputTokens`. The cache counts are a subset of the normalized input count, so adding them double counts the cached tokens.

## View realized costs

When you configure a [model cost catalog]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/cost-controls/costs/" >}}), {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} computes the realized USD cost of each LLM request and exposes it across the observability surface:

* **Logs**: each LLM request log line includes `agw.ai.usage.cost.total`. Add the cost breakdown or applied rates with CEL `llm.cost` and `llm.costRates` fields.
* **Metrics**: the `agentgateway_cost_catalog_lookups_total` counter tracks lookups by `status` (`Exact`, `Unpriced`, `Missing`, or `NoCatalog`) and by provider and model, so you can confirm that your catalog prices your traffic.
* **Traces**: cost attributes are attached to the request span.

For catalog configuration and the full list of cost fields, see [Model costs]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/cost-controls/costs/" >}}).

## Track per-user metrics

When you set up API key authentication with per-user rate limiting, you can filter token usage metrics by user ID to track spending and usage patterns for each virtual key.

For a complete virtual key setup guide, see [Virtual key management]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/cost-controls/virtual-keys/" >}}).

Example PromQL query for per-user token usage:
```promql
# Total tokens consumed by each user
sum by (user_id) (
  agentgateway_gen_ai_client_token_usage_sum{gen_ai_token_type="input"} +
  agentgateway_gen_ai_client_token_usage_sum{gen_ai_token_type="output"}
)
```

## View logs

{{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway-capital.md" >}} automatically logs information to stdout. When you run {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} on your local machine, you can view a log entry for each request that is sent to {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} in your CLI output. 

To view the logs: 
```sh {paths="llm-observability"}
kubectl logs deployment/agentgateway-proxy -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
```

Example for a successful request to the OpenAI LLM: 
```
2025-12-12T21:56:02.809082Z	info	request gateway=agentgateway-system/agentgateway-proxy listener=http
route=agentgateway-system/openai endpoint=api.openai.com:443 src.addr=127.0.0.1:60862 http.method=POST

```

{{< doc-test paths="llm-observability" >}}
kubectl logs deployment/agentgateway-proxy -n agentgateway-system | grep "gen_ai.usage.input_tokens"

## Tool calls {#tool-calls}

When a model responds with tool or function calls, the gateway can carry those calls into your telemetry. Unlike the `gen_ai` fields in the preceding log line, tool calls are not collected automatically. You must reference the `llm.toolCalls` CEL field in an access log or tracing attribute to turn on extraction.

Add an access log attribute and a trace span field to capture the tools that were accessed. In the following example, the extracted tool information is added as a `toolCalls` attribute to your access logs, and as a `gen_ai.tool_calls` field to your trace spans.

```yaml
kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/api-version.md" >}}
kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}}
metadata:
  name: llm-telemetry
  namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
spec:
  targetRefs:
  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
    name: agentgateway-proxy
  frontend:
    accessLog:
      attributes:
        add:
        - name: toolCalls
          expression: llm.toolCalls
    tracing:
      backendRef:
        name: opentelemetry-collector
        namespace: telemetry
        port: 4317
      protocol: GRPC
      attributes:
        add:
        - name: gen_ai.tool_calls
          expression: llm.toolCalls
EOF
```

Example value for the `toolCalls` access log attribute: 

```
toolCalls=[{"id": "call_abc123", "name": "get_weather", "arguments": {"location": "Paris"}}]
```

The gateway extracts tool calls from every response format that it supports. For streaming responses, the gateway reassembles arguments that the provider splits across chunks into a single object when the stream ends.

When a response carries no tool calls, the gateway omits the attribute from both the log line and the span, rather than recording an empty array. To find the requests that used tools, filter for the attribute name.

> [!NOTE]
> Reading `llm.toolCalls` has a performance cost for large responses, because the gateway must inspect the response body. Attach the policy only to the routes where you need tool call data, instead of to the gateway.
