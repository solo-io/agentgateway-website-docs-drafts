## About access logging

Access logs, sometimes referred to as audit logs, represent all traffic requests that pass through the gateway proxy. The access log entries can be customized to include data from the request, the routing destination, and the response. 

### Data that can be logged

Access log content is controlled by [CEL (Common Expression Language)](https://agentgateway.dev/docs/kubernetes/main/reference/cel/) expressions. You can filter which requests are logged and define custom attributes from the request and response.

For logging, CEL exposes these variable groups when enabled or applicable:

* **request**: method, URI, host, path, headers, body, and timing
* **response**: status code, headers, and body
* **source**: client address, port, and TLS identity
* **backend**: backend name, type, and protocol
* **Auth and metadata**: `jwt`, `apiKey`, or `basicAuth`, plus `extauthz` and `extproc` metadata
* **LLM**: model, provider, token counts, and optional prompt/completion{{< version include-if="1.0.x,1.1.x,1.2.x,1.3.x" >}}/tool calls{{< /version >}}
* **MCP**: tool, prompt, and resource name and target

{{< version exclude-if="1.5.x,1.4.x,1.3.x,1.2.x,1.1.x,1.0.x,2.2.x" >}}
* **Guardrails**: `guardrails`, with entries for prompt-guard evaluations naming the phase, the guard, and the action, including `allow`
* **MCP guardrails**: `mcpGuardrails`, with dynamic metadata that an ExtMCP request-phase processor returns

Use the `filter` field in the {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}} to [filter which requests are logged](#filter-access-logs) by path, response code, or any other request attribute. Use the `attributes` list to [add or remove log fields](#add-and-remove-log-fields) by using CEL expressions. For the full variable table, available functions, and examples, see the [CEL expressions reference]({{< link-hextra path="/reference/cel/" >}}).

3. [Set up the OTel stack]({{< link path="/documentation/observability/otel-stack/" >}}) to export logs to an OTel collector and forward them to Loki. 

## Enable access logs {#access-log-stdout-filesink}

Access logs are written to `stdout` automatically for every request that passes through the gateway proxy. No policy configuration is required to enable them.

1. Send a request to the httpbin app on the `www.example.com` domain.

   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:80/get -H "host: www.example.com"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab name="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i localhost:8080/get -H "host: www.example.com"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

2. Check the gateway logs to see the access log entry for the request.

   ```sh
   kubectl -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} logs deployments/agentgateway-proxy | tail -1
   ```

   Example output:
   ```console
   info	request gateway=agentgateway-system/agentgateway-proxy
   listener=http route=httpbin/httpbin endpoint=10.244.0.4:8080
   src.addr=127.0.0.1:46886 http.method=GET http.host=www.example.com
   http.path=/get http.version=HTTP/1.1 http.status=200
   protocol=http duration=0ms
   ```

To filter which requests are logged or customize log fields, see [Filter access logs](#filter-access-logs) and [Add and remove log fields](#add-and-remove-log-fields). To export access logs to an external backend over OTLP, see [Export logs over OTLP]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/observability/access-logs/export/" >}}).

{{< version exclude-if="1.5.x" >}}
## Use OpenTelemetry field names {#preset}

By default, the stdout access log uses short, human-oriented field names, such as `http.path`. To rename the built-in HTTP fields to their [OpenTelemetry semantic convention](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/http/http-spans/) equivalents, such as `url.path`, set `preset: Otel` in the access log policy.

Use this preset when you ship stdout logs to a pipeline that already expects semantic convention attribute names, so that you do not have to rename the fields downstream.

1. Create an {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}} resource that sets the preset.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/api-version.md" >}}
   kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}}
   metadata:
     name: access-logs-otel
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     targetRefs:
     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
       kind: Gateway
       name: agentgateway-proxy
     frontend:
       accessLog:
         preset: Otel
   EOF
   ```

2. Send a request that includes a query string, such as `/get?foo=bar`, and check the gateway logs. The built-in HTTP fields now use semantic convention names.

   ```console
   info	request gateway=agentgateway-system/agentgateway-proxy
   listener=http route=httpbin/httpbin endpoint=10.244.0.7:8080
   client.address=127.0.0.1 http.request.method=GET server.address=www.example.com
   url.path=/get network.protocol.version=1.1 http.response.status_code=200
   protocol=http duration=0ms url.scheme=http url.query=foo=bar
   ```

The preset renames the following built-in fields.

| Default field | Field with `preset: Otel` |
| -- | -- |
| `src.addr` | `client.address`. The value is the client IP address without the port. |
| `http.method` | `http.request.method` |
| `http.host` | `server.address` |
| `http.path` | `url.path`. The value is the path only. Any query string moves to a separate `url.query` field instead of staying on the path. |
| `http.version` | `network.protocol.version`. The value is the bare version, such as `1.1` instead of `HTTP/1.1`. |
| `http.status` | `http.response.status_code` |

The preset also adds `url.scheme`, and it adds `server.port` and `url.query` when the request supplies them. These added fields are appended to the end of the log line, after `duration`, rather than placed next to the other HTTP fields.

Fields that you add yourself with the `attributes` field are not renamed, so choose semantic convention names for them if you want the whole line to be consistent. Fields that are not part of the HTTP field set, such as `gateway`, `route`, and `duration`, keep their names.

> [!NOTE]
> The preset changes only the stdout access log, and only for HTTP traffic. A TCP listener has no HTTP field set to rename, so the preset has no effect there. An OTLP export already uses semantic convention attribute names, so it is unaffected. For more information, see [Export logs over OTLP]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/observability/access-logs/export/" >}}).
{{< /version >}}

{{< version exclude-if="1.5.x,1.4.x,1.3.x,1.2.x,1.1.x,1.0.x,2.2.x" >}}
## Log the selected backend endpoint {#backend-endpoint}

Use `backend.endpoint` in an access log expression to record the resolved destination of a directly addressed backend, such as a static hostname, including its port for a network endpoint. `backend.name` identifies the configured backend; `backend.endpoint` identifies the selected call target. The endpoint is available only after target resolution. Service backends leave `backend.endpoint` unset because their workload endpoints are selected separately.

Add an attribute to the `frontend.accessLog.attributes.add` list in your policy. Guard the lookup for Service backends and requests rejected before a backend is resolved.

```yaml
frontend:
  accessLog:
    attributes:
      add:
      - name: backend_endpoint
        expression: 'has(backend.endpoint) ? backend.endpoint : ""'
```
{{< /version >}}

## Filter access logs

Use a [CEL expression]({{< link path="/reference/cel/" >}}) to log only a subset of requests. Requests that do not match the expression are not logged. 

1. Create an {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}} resource with a `filter` expression. The following example produces access logs only for requests with a response code of 400 or greater.

   ```yaml {linenos=table,paths="access-logging"}
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/api-version.md" >}}
   kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}}
   metadata:
     name: access-logs
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     targetRefs:
     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
       kind: Gateway
       name: agentgateway-proxy
     frontend:
       accessLog:
         filter: 'response.code >= 400'
   EOF
   ```

2. Send a request that returns a 400 response code.

   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:80/status/400 -H "host: www.example.com"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab name="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i localhost:8080/status/400 -H "host: www.example.com"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

3. Check the gateway logs and verify that an access log entry was written for the 400 request.

   ```sh
   kubectl -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} logs deployments/agentgateway-proxy | tail -1
   ```

   Example output:
   ```console {hl_lines=[4]}
   info	request gateway=agentgateway-system/agentgateway-proxy
   listener=http route=httpbin/httpbin endpoint=10.244.0.4:8080
   src.addr=127.0.0.1:46886 http.method=GET http.host=www.example.com
   http.path=/status/400 http.version=HTTP/1.1 http.status=400
   protocol=http duration=0ms
   ```

4. Send a successful request.

   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:80/get -H "host: www.example.com"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab name="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i localhost:8080/get -H "host: www.example.com"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

5. Check the logs again and verify that no new entry appears. Because the response code was `200`, the filter expression `response.code >= 400` does not match and no log is written.

   ```sh
   kubectl -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} logs deployments/agentgateway-proxy | tail -1
   ```

   Example output (the last entry is still the 400 request from step 2):
   ```console {hl_lines=[4]}
   info	request gateway=agentgateway-system/agentgateway-proxy
   listener=http route=httpbin/httpbin endpoint=10.244.0.4:8080
   src.addr=127.0.0.1:46886 http.method=GET http.host=www.example.com
   http.path=/status/400 http.version=HTTP/1.1 http.status=400
   protocol=http duration=0ms
   ```

  {{< doc-test paths="access-logging" >}}
  YAMLTest -f - <<'EOF'

      type: local
    expect:
      statusCode: 400
  - name: verify 400 request was logged
    command:
      command: "kubectl logs -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} deployments/agentgateway-proxy"
    source:
      type: local
    expect:
      exitCode: 0
      stdout:
        contains: "http.status=400"
  - name: verify 200 request is returned
    http:
      url: "http://${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}"
      path: /get
      method: GET
      headers:
        host: www.example.com
    source:
      type: local
    expect:
      statusCode: 200
  - name: verify 200 request was not logged (last log entry is still the 400)
    command:
      command: "kubectl logs -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} deployments/agentgateway-proxy | tail -1"
    source:
      type: local
    expect:
      exitCode: 0
      stdout:
        contains: "http.status=400"
  EOF
  {{< /doc-test >}}

## Add and remove log fields

You can add custom fields to every access log line by using CEL expressions that are evaluated against the request and response context. You can also remove default fields that you do not need.

1. Create an {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}} resource that adds custom attributes and removes a default field. The following example adds 3 fields to every access log entry:
   - `user_id`: Extracts the value of the `x-user-id` request header.
   - `env`: Adds a static string of `production`.

   The example also removes the `http.host` default field.

   ```yaml {linenos=table,paths="access-logging"}
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/api-version.md" >}}
   kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}}
   metadata:
     name: access-logs
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     targetRefs:
     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
       kind: Gateway
       name: agentgateway-proxy
     frontend:
       accessLog:
         attributes:
           add:
           - name: user_id
             expression: 'request.headers["x-user-id"]'
           - name: env
             expression: '"production"'
           remove:
           - http.host
   EOF
   ```

2. Send a request with an `x-user-id` header.

   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:80/get -H "host: www.example.com" -H "x-user-id: user-123"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab name="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i localhost:8080/get -H "host: www.example.com" -H "x-user-id: user-123"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

3. Check the gateway logs and verify you can see the custom fields in your log entry, and that the `http.host` field is absent.

   ```sh
   kubectl -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} logs deployments/agentgateway-proxy | tail -1
   ```

   Example output:
   ```console {hl_lines=[5]}
   info	request gateway=agentgateway-system/agentgateway-proxy
   listener=http route=httpbin/httpbin endpoint=10.244.0.4:8080
   src.addr=127.0.0.1:46886 http.method=GET http.path=/get
   http.version=HTTP/1.1 http.status=200 protocol=http duration=0ms
   user_id="user-123" env="production"
   ```

  {{< doc-test paths="access-logging" >}}
  YAMLTest -f - <<'EOF'
  - name: verify request with x-user-id header returns 200

      headers:
        host: www.example.com

      type: local
    expect:
      exitCode: 0
      stdout:

      command: "kubectl logs -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} deployments/agentgateway-proxy"
    source:
      type: local
    expect:
      exitCode: 0
      stdout:
        contains: "env=\"production\""
  EOF
  {{< /doc-test >}}

## Log guardrail results {#guardrails}

Prompt guards record their evaluation results in the request's dynamic metadata, under the `guardrails` variable. Results include `allow` when a guard accepts the content, as well as actions that mask, reject, audit, or fail open. Add the variable to an access log field to record which guards ran and their outcomes.

The variable holds entries for guardrail evaluations in either the request or the response phase. A nonempty list does not necessarily mean that a guardrail intervened: every entry might have the action `allow`.

If a request guard rejects an LLM request before the provider call, the access log still receives request-side LLM metadata and the `guardrails` entry. Provider response fields are absent because the request never reaches the LLM provider.

The following table describes the properties of each result in the `guardrails` list. Agentgateway populates these values when a guard runs; they are not configuration fields. The `[]` notation means "each entry in the list" and is not literal CEL syntax. For example, `guardrails[0].action` reads the first result's action.

| Result property | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `guardrails[].phase` | The phase that the guardrail evaluated, either `request` or `response`. |
| `guardrails[].guard` | The guard kind that was evaluated, such as `regex`, `webhook`, `openAIModeration`, `bedrockGuardrails`, `googleModelArmor`, or `azureContentSafety`. |
| `guardrails[].action` | The action that the guardrail took, one of `allow`, `mask`, `reject`, `audit`, or `failOpen`. |
| `guardrails[].guardrailId` | The configured guardrail identifier. |
| `guardrails[].guardrailVersion` | The configured guardrail version. |
| `guardrails[].actionReason` | The reason that the guardrail reported for its action. |
| `guardrails[].assessments` | The assessment detail that the guardrail provider reported, redacted to metadata only. Content-bearing fields, such as the matched text, are never included. |

> [!NOTE]
> Only CEL that runs after the request completes, such as an access log field or a metric field, receives the `guardrails` variable. An authorization or transformation expression that runs mid-request never sees it.

Set `spec.frontend.accessLog.filter` to a CEL expression that returns `true` for requests you want to log. The `size()` function counts list entries, and the `exists` macro checks whether any entry matches a condition. They are CEL operations on the list, rather than result properties from the table.

| Value of `spec.frontend.accessLog.filter` | Requests logged |
| --- | --- |
| `guardrails.size() > 0` | Requests with at least one guardrail result, including requests that every guard allows. |
| `guardrails.exists(g, g.action != "allow")` | Requests with at least one result whose action is not `allow`. The variable `g` represents each result as the condition is checked. |

To choose what is recorded in a log field, set `spec.frontend.accessLog.attributes.add[].expression`. The following {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}} uses `guardrails` to record the whole list and `guardrails.size() > 0` to select requests with results. To record just the first result's action, use `guardrails[0].action` as the attribute expression with the same nonempty-list filter.

```yaml
kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/api-version.md" >}}
kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}}
metadata:
  name: guardrail-access-logs
  namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
spec:
  targetRefs:
  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway

      attributes:
        add:
        - name: guardrails
          expression: guardrails
EOF
```

Access logging is a frontend policy, so it attaches to a Gateway rather than to the LLM backend that the prompt guard attaches to. To set up a guard that produces these entries, see the [guardrails]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/guardrails/" >}}) docs.

## View access logs in Loki {#view-in-loki}

If you set up the [OTel stack]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/observability/otel-stack/" >}}), the `opentelemetry-collector-logs` deployment is ready to receive access logs via OTLPs. Configure the agentgateway proxy to send access logs to it, then query them in Grafana through Loki.

1. Create a {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}} resource that points the agentgateway proxy at the OTel collector.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/api-version.md" >}}
   kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}}
   metadata:
     name: access-logs
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     targetRefs:
     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
       kind: Gateway
       name: agentgateway-proxy
     frontend:
       accessLog:
         otlp:
           backendRef:
             name: opentelemetry-collector-logs
             namespace: telemetry
             port: 4317
           protocol: GRPC
   EOF
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > To filter which logs are exported, add custom fields, or send logs to a different backend, see [Export logs over OTLP]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/observability/access-logs/export/" >}}).

2. Open Grafana.  

   1. Port-forward the Grafana service.
      ```sh
      kubectl port-forward svc/kube-prometheus-stack-grafana -n telemetry 3000:80
      ```
   2. Open Grafana at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

   3. Log in to Grafana with the `admin` username `prom-operator` password .

3. Go to **Explore** and select **Loki** as the data source.

4. Use the **Label browser** to find your log stream, then add filters to narrow results. Each proxied request is stored as a log entry with structured metadata attributes such as `http.method`, `http.path`, and `http.status`. Use the following filter patterns:

   | Goal | LogQL filter |
   |---|---|
   | Requests to a specific path | `\| http_path="/get"` |
   | Error responses (4xx/5xx) | `\| http_status="400"` or `\| http_status="500"` |
   | Logs from a specific gateway | `\| gateway="agentgateway-system/agentgateway-proxy"` |

## Log MCP guardrail metadata {#mcp-guardrails}

An ExtMCP request-phase guardrail can return dynamic metadata with a `Pass` or mutated result. After the MCP request completes, access-log CEL can read that metadata from the `mcpGuardrails` variable. Access-log CEL can also read the metadata for requests that resume a stateful MCP session. Use `mcpGuardrails` to record policy-server decisions that are not part of the default MCP log fields.

The metadata keys depend on the ExtMCP server response. The following example records the `decision` key when the policy server returns metadata such as `{"decision":"allow"}`.

```yaml
frontend:
  accessLog:
    attributes:
      add:
      - name: mcp_guardrail_decision
        expression: 'mcpGuardrails != null ? string(mcpGuardrails.decision) : ""'
```
