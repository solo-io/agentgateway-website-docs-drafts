## Set up JWT authentication

Configure an {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}} to validate JWTs using a remote JWKS endpoint from Keycloak. This approach is recommended for production as it supports automatic key rotation.

1. Create an {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}} with JWT authentication configuration.
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/api-version.md" >}}
   kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}}
   metadata:
     name: jwt-auth-policy
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     # Target the Gateway to apply JWT authentication to all routes
     targetRefs:
     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
       kind: Gateway
       name: agentgateway-proxy   
     # Configure JWT authentication
     traffic:
       jwtAuthentication:
         # Validation mode - determines how strictly JWTs are validated
         mode: Strict   
         # List of JWT providers (identity providers)
         providers:
         - # Issuer URL - must match the 'iss' claim in JWT tokens
           issuer: "${KEYCLOAK_ISSUER}"
           # JWKS configuration for remote key fetching
           jwks:
             remote:
               # Path to the JWKS endpoint, relative to the backend root
               jwksPath: "${KEYCLOAK_JWKS_PATH}"
               # Cache duration for JWKS keys (reduces load on identity provider)
               cacheDuration: "5m"
               # Reference to the Keycloak service
               backendRef:
                 group: ""
                 kind: Service
                 name: keycloak
                 namespace: keycloak
                 port: 8080
   EOF
   ```

   {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/review-table.md" >}}

   | Field | Description |
   |-------|-------------|
   | `mode` | Validation mode for JWT authentication. `Strict` requires a valid JWT for all requests. `Optional` validates JWTs if present but allows requests without tokens. `Permissive` is the least strict mode.<br><br>Example value: `Strict` |
   | `issuer` | The issuer URL that must match the `iss` claim in JWT tokens exactly. Agentgateway rejects tokens from other issuers.{{< version exclude-if="1.3.x,1.2.x,1.1.x,1.0.x" >}} Agentgateway also rejects a token that has no `iss` claim.{{< /version >}}<br><br>Example value: `http://keycloak:8080/realms/master` |
   | `audiences` | List of allowed audience values. The JWT's `aud` claim must contain at least one of these values. Omit the field to accept any audience.{{< version exclude-if="1.3.x,1.2.x,1.1.x,1.0.x" >}} An empty list also accepts any audience, and a non-empty list rejects a token that has no `aud` claim.{{< /version >}}<br><br>Example value: `["my-application"]` |{{< version exclude-if="1.3.x,1.2.x,1.1.x,1.0.x" >}}
   | `preserveToken` | Keeps a validated JWT in the location that it was read from. By default, the gateway removes the token after validation, so the backend does not receive the client's credential. Set this field when another policy on the same route reads the token from the request, such as an OAuth token exchange{{< version include-if="1.4.x,1.3.x,1.2.x,1.1.x,1.0.x" >}} ([OAuth token exchange]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/security/backend-authn/oauth-token-exchange/" >}})){{< /version >}}{{< version exclude-if="1.4.x,1.3.x,1.2.x,1.1.x,1.0.x" >}} ([Standard token exchange]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/security/backend-authn/token-exchange/standard/" >}})){{< /version >}} that takes it as the subject token. When only the backend needs the token, prefer the `passthrough` [backend authentication]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/security/backend-authn/" >}}) method instead, which does not expose the credential to every policy that runs later.<br><br>Example value: `true` |{{< /version >}}
   | `jwks.remote.jwksPath` | The path to the JWKS endpoint on the identity provider, relative to the backend root. This endpoint returns the public keys used to verify JWT signatures. {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/jwks-path.md" >}}<br><br>Example value: `/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/certs` |
   | `jwks.remote.cacheDuration` | How long to cache the JWKS keys locally. This setting reduces load on the identity provider and improves performance. Keys are automatically refreshed when the cache expires.<br><br>Example value: `5m` (5 minutes) |
   | `jwks.remote.backendRef` | Reference to the backend that hosts the identity provider. Agentgateway uses this value to fetch the JWKS keys from the identity provider. For an in-cluster provider, reference a Kubernetes Service. For an external provider that is reached over TLS, reference an {{< reuse "/agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}} instead. See [External identity provider over TLS](#external-identity-provider-over-tls).{{< version exclude-if="1.4.x,1.3.x,1.2.x,1.1.x,1.0.x,2026.7.1,2.3.x,2.2.x,2.1.x" >}} Mutually exclusive with `url`. Set exactly one of the two.{{< /version >}} <br><br>Example value: The details of the Keycloak service |{{< version exclude-if="1.4.x,1.3.x,1.2.x,1.1.x,1.0.x,2026.7.1,2.3.x,2.2.x,2.1.x" >}}
   | `jwks.remote.url` | The full address of the JWKS endpoint, including the path. Use this field instead of `backendRef` and `jwksPath` to point at the identity provider directly, without creating an intermediate Kubernetes object. When the scheme is `https`, backend TLS is enabled automatically, so you do not need a separate `BackendTLSPolicy`. Mutually exclusive with `backendRef`. Do not set `jwksPath` when you use `url`.<br><br>Example value: `https://my-org.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/keys` |{{< /version >}}


2. View the details of the policy. Verify that the policy is accepted.
   ```sh
   kubectl get {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}} jwt-auth-policy -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} -o json | jq '.status'
   ```

## Verify JWT authentication

Now that JWT authentication is configured, test the setup by obtaining a token from Keycloak and making authenticated requests.

1. Send a request to the httpbin app without any JWT token. Verify that the request fails with a 401 HTTP response code. 
   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -v "${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}:80/headers" -H "host: www.example.com"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab name="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i localhost:8080/headers -H "host: www.example.com"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

   Example output: 
   ```
   HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
   content-type: text/plain
   response-gateway: response path /headers
   content-length: 45
   date: Mon, 19 Jan 2026 16:07:12 GMT

   authentication failure: no bearer token found%  
   ```      
   
2. Register a client with Keycloak. The client uses dynamic client registration (DCR), so no administrator creates it, and Keycloak returns the client ID and secret that the next step uses.

   > [!WARNING]
   > The Keycloak instance in this guide allows anonymous DCR, which is why you can register this client without an administrator credential. Use this shortcut only in a local test environment. In production, create machine clients through your identity provider's normal process, and do not allow DCR clients to use the client credentials grant.

   ```sh {paths="jwt-claims"}
   REGISTRATION=$(curl --fail --silent --show-error \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "client_name": "jwt-auth-guide",
       "grant_types": ["client_credentials"],
       "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_basic"
     }' \
     "$KEYCLOAK_URL/realms/master/clients-registrations/openid-connect")

   KEYCLOAK_CLIENT=$(jq -r .client_id <<<"$REGISTRATION")
   KEYCLOAK_SECRET=$(jq -r .client_secret <<<"$REGISTRATION")
   echo $KEYCLOAK_CLIENT
   ```

3. Get an access token for the client by using the client credentials grant. A service that calls your API uses this grant to authenticate as itself, with no user involved. This token identifies the client, not a person, so it carries no username.
   ```sh {paths="jwt-claims"}
   ACCESS_TOKEN=$(curl -s -u "${KEYCLOAK_CLIENT}:${KEYCLOAK_SECRET}" \
     -d grant_type=client_credentials \
     "${KEYCLOAK_URL}/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token" \
     | jq -r '.access_token')
   
   echo $ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```

   {{< doc-test paths="jwt-claims" >}}
   if [ -z "${ACCESS_TOKEN:-}" ] || [ "${ACCESS_TOKEN}" = "null" ]; then
     echo "no access token issued for the client; check the client registration in the previous step"
     exit 1
   fi
   {{< /doc-test >}}

4. Repeat the request to the httpbin app. This time, include the JWT token that you received in the previous step. Verify that the request succeeds and you get back a 200 HTTP response code. 
   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -v "${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}:80/headers" -H "host: www.example.com" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab name="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -v "http://localhost:8080/headers" -H "host: www.example.com" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

   Example output: 
   ```
   ...
   < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   ...
   {
    "headers": {
      "Accept": [
        "*/*"
      ],
      "Host": [
        "www.example.com"
      ],
      "User-Agent": [
        "curl/8.7.1"
      ]
    }
   }
   ```
  

## Authorize requests by a JWT claim

Authentication proves who sent the request. Authorization decides what that identity is allowed to do. After agentgateway validates the JWT, the claims are available to Common Expression Language (CEL) expressions through the `jwt` variable, so you can write access rules against them in the same {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}}.

This distinction matters when DCR is enabled. Registration lets a client obtain a token from the identity provider, but it does not grant that client access to your backends. Authorization is what decides what actions the client can perform.

1. Update the `jwt-auth-policy` to add an authorization rule. The following example allows only the client that you registered, and denies every other identity.
   ```yaml {paths="jwt-claims"}
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/api-version.md" >}}
   kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}}
   metadata:
     name: jwt-auth-policy
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     targetRefs:
     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
       kind: Gateway
       name: agentgateway-proxy
     traffic:
       jwtAuthentication:
         mode: Strict
         providers:
         - issuer: "${KEYCLOAK_ISSUER}"
           jwks:
             remote:
               jwksPath: "${KEYCLOAK_JWKS_PATH}"
               cacheDuration: "5m"
               backendRef:
                 group: ""
                 kind: Service
                 name: keycloak
                 namespace: keycloak
                 port: 8080
       # Allow only the identity that the JWT belongs to
       authorization:
         action: Allow
         policy:
           matchExpressions:
           - "jwt.azp == '${KEYCLOAK_CLIENT}'"
   EOF
   ```

   | Field | Description |
   |-------|-------------|
   | `traffic.authorization.action` | The effect of the rule when it matches. When at least one `Allow` rule is configured, agentgateway denies every request that no allow rule matches. |
   | `traffic.authorization.policy.matchExpressions` | The CEL expressions that must all evaluate to true for the rule to match. This example compares the `azp` claim, which Keycloak sets to the client ID that the token was issued to. |

   > [!NOTE]
   > Authorization runs only after authentication succeeds. A request with a missing or invalid token fails JWT authentication and returns a `401` before any expression is evaluated. Authorization denials return a `403`.

   {{< doc-test paths="jwt-claims" >}}
   YAMLTest -f - <<'EOF'
   - name: wait for jwt-auth-policy with authorization to be accepted
     wait:
       target:

       polling:
         timeoutSeconds: 60
         intervalSeconds: 2
   EOF
   {{< /doc-test >}}

2. Repeat the request with the client's token. Verify that the request still succeeds, because the `azp` claim matches the allow rule.
   ```sh
   curl -v "${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}:80/headers" -H "host: www.example.com" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
   ```

3. Register a second client, get a token for it, and send the same request. Verify that the request fails with a `403 Forbidden` response code. The token is valid, so authentication succeeds, but no allow rule matches the second client.
   ```sh {paths="jwt-claims"}
   OTHER_REGISTRATION=$(curl --fail --silent --show-error \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "client_name": "jwt-auth-guide-other",
       "grant_types": ["client_credentials"],
       "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_basic"
     }' \

   OTHER_TOKEN=$(curl -s \

## Other JWT auth examples

Review other common JWT auth configuration examples that you can add to your {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}}.

### Multiple JWT providers

You can configure multiple JWT providers to accept tokens from different identity providers. The following example uses Keycloak and the Auth0 identity providers. 

{{< version exclude-if="1.5.x" >}}When a request includes a JWT, the agentgateway proxy selects a provider by the token's `iss` claim and `kid` header. This selection lets two issuers publish the same `kid` value without the proxy validating the token against the wrong provider.{{< /version >}}

```yaml

traffic:
  jwtAuthentication:
    mode: Strict
    providers:
    - issuer: "${KEYCLOAK_ISSUER}"
      audiences: ["my-application"]
      jwks:
        remote:
          jwksPath: "${KEYCLOAK_JWKS_PATH}"
          backendRef:
            name: keycloak
            namespace: keycloak
            kind: Service
            port: 8080
    - issuer: "https://auth0.example.com/"
      audiences: ["my-other-application"]
      jwks:
        remote:
          jwksPath: "/.well-known/jwks.json"
          backendRef:
            name: auth0-proxy
            namespace: auth-system
            kind: Service
            port: 443
```

### External identity provider over TLS

When your identity provider runs outside the cluster (for example, Okta, Auth0, or Microsoft Entra ID) and is served over HTTPS, reference an {{< reuse "/agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}} in the `jwks.remote.backendRef` instead of a Kubernetes Service. The {{< reuse "/agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}} sets the upstream host and TLS SNI together, so the JWKS fetch connects to the provider with the correct hostname and certificate.

1. Create an {{< reuse "/agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}} for the identity provider. Set `static.host` to the provider's public hostname and `policies.tls.sni` to the same hostname. Because no `caCertificateRefs` are set, the provider's certificate is verified against the system trust store. A `policies.tls` section is required even on port 443: without it the gateway fetches the JWKS in clear text against the HTTPS port, the fetch fails and retries with backoff, and the policy still reports `Accepted=True`, so the only symptom is that every valid token is rejected.
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: {{< reuse "/agw-docs/snippets/api-version.md" >}}
   kind: {{< reuse "/agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}}
   metadata:
     name: okta-jwks
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     static:
       host: myorg.okta.com
       port: 443
     policies:
       tls:
         sni: myorg.okta.com
   EOF
   ```
   {{< version exclude-if="1.0.x,1.1.x,1.2.x,1.3.x,1.4.x,1.5.x" >}}
   If your identity provider presents a certificate that is signed by a private CA, add `policies.tls.caCertificateRefs` to the {{< reuse "/agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}}. The certificate must be in a ConfigMap or a Secret in the same namespace as the {{< reuse "/agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}}. Omit `kind` to read the certificate from a ConfigMap, or set `kind: Secret` to read it from a Secret, such as a Secret that cert-manager issues. The certificate is read from the `ca.crt` key, unless you set `key` to another key name.

   ```yaml
       policies:
         tls:
           sni: myorg.okta.com
           caCertificateRefs:
           - name: idp-ca
             kind: Secret
   ```
   {{< /version >}}

2. Create an {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}} that points `jwks.remote.backendRef` at the {{< reuse "/agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}} that you created.
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/api-version.md" >}}
   kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}}
   metadata:
     name: jwt-auth-policy
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     # Target the Gateway to apply JWT authentication to all routes
     targetRefs:
     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
       kind: Gateway
       name: agentgateway-proxy
     # Configure JWT authentication
     traffic:
       jwtAuthentication:
         mode: Strict
         providers:
         - issuer: "https://myorg.okta.com/oauth2/default"
           audiences: ["my-application"]
           jwks:
             remote:
               jwksPath: "/oauth2/default/v1/keys"
               cacheDuration: "5m"
               backendRef:
                 group: {{< reuse "/agw-docs/snippets/group.md" >}}
                 kind: {{< reuse "/agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}}
                 name: okta-jwks
                 port: 443
   EOF
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the {{< reuse "/agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}} is in a different namespace than the {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}}, add the `namespace` field to the `backendRef` and create a `ReferenceGrant` that permits the cross-namespace reference.

### Inline JWKS

For testing purposes, you can use inline JWKS instead of a remote JWKS endpoint. Note that this setup is not recommended for production as it requires manual key updates.

```yaml

traffic:
  jwtAuthentication:
    mode: Strict
    providers:
    - issuer: "${KEYCLOAK_ISSUER}"
      audiences: ["my-application"]
      jwks:
        inline: '{"keys":[{"kty":"RSA","kid":"key-id-123","use":"sig","n":"0vx7agoebG...","e":"AQAB"}]}'
```

### Allow missing

By default, the JWT validation mode is set to `Strict` and allows connections to a backend destination only if a valid JWT was provided as part of the request. 

To allow requests, even if no JWT was provided or if the JWT cannot be validated, use the `Permissive` or `Optional` modes. 

**Optional**

The JWT is optional. If a JWT is provided during the request, the agentgateway proxy validates it. In the case that the JWT validation fails, the request is denied. However, keep in mind that if no JWT is provided during the request, the request is explicitly allowed. 

```yaml

traffic:
  jwtAuthentication:
    mode: Optional
    providers:
    - issuer: "${KEYCLOAK_ISSUER}"
      audiences: ["my-application"]
      jwks:
        remote:
          jwksPath: "${KEYCLOAK_JWKS_PATH}"
          backendRef:
            name: keycloak
            namespace: keycloak
            kind: Service
            port: 8080
```

**Permissive**

Requests are never rejected, even if no or invalid JWTs are provided during the request.

```yaml

traffic:
  jwtAuthentication:
    mode: Permissive
    providers:
    - issuer: "${KEYCLOAK_ISSUER}"
      audiences: ["my-application"]
      jwks:
        remote:
          jwksPath: "${KEYCLOAK_JWKS_PATH}"
          backendRef:
            name: keycloak
            namespace: keycloak
            kind: Service
            port: 8080
```

### PreRouting phase

By default, JWT authentication is enforced during routing. Use the `PreRouting` phase to validate JWTs before any routing decision is made. This is useful when you want to enforce authentication for all traffic at the gateway level, regardless of the route.

```yaml

traffic:
  phase: PreRouting
  jwtAuthentication:
    mode: Strict
    providers:
    - issuer: "${KEYCLOAK_ISSUER}"
      audiences: ["my-application"]
      jwks:
        remote:
          jwksPath: "${KEYCLOAK_JWKS_PATH}"
          cacheDuration: "5m"
          backendRef:
            name: keycloak
            namespace: keycloak
            kind: Service
            port: 8080
```



## Use JWT claims in transformations {#jwt-claims-transformations}

After a JWT is validated, its claims are available to [CEL expressions]({{< link-hextra path="/reference/cel/" >}}) through the `jwt` context variable. You can use these claims in [transformations]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/traffic-management/transformations/" >}}) to forward the authenticated user's identity to your backends, or to route requests based on a claim. See [Claim-based routing](#claim-based-routing).

The `jwt` variable is populated only after the JWT is validated. Keep `jwtAuthentication` and the `transformation` on the same {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}} and phase so that both apply to the same requests. JWT authentication always runs before transformations in the request pipeline, so the claims are available when the transformation evaluates them.

### Available JWT claims {#available-jwt-claims}

Access standard and custom claims from the `jwt` variable. Registered claims, such as `sub`, use dot notation. Custom claims whose names contain special characters, such as a URL, require bracket notation.

| CEL expression | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `jwt.sub` | The subject (`sub`) claim, which is usually the user ID. |
| `jwt.iss` | The issuer (`iss`) claim. |
| `jwt.aud` | The audience (`aud`) claim. |
| `jwt.exp` | The expiration (`exp`) time, as a Unix timestamp. |
| `jwt['custom-claim']` | Any custom claim. Use bracket notation for claim names that contain special characters, such as `jwt['https://example.com/tier']`. |
| `jwt.rawToken` | The raw bearer token. Redacted by default. Use `jwt.rawToken.unredacted()` to access the value. |

Because the `value` field of a transformation is a CEL expression, `jwt.sub` refers to the claim value, not the literal string `jwt.sub`. To set a header to a fixed string instead, wrap the value in inner single quotes, such as `value: "'my-value'"`. A claim might also be absent from a token, so wrap claim access in `default()` to provide a fallback and avoid errors, such as `default(jwt.role, 'user')`. For the full list of context variables and functions, see the [CEL reference]({{< link-hextra path="/reference/cel/" >}}).

### Forward JWT claims to a backend

In this example, you add a transformation to the JWT policy that copies claims from the validated token into request headers before the request is forwarded to the backend. This is a common way to pass the authenticated user's identity to upstream apps without having them parse the JWT.

1. Update the `jwt-auth-policy` to add a `transformation` that sets request headers from JWT claims. The `x-user-role` header uses `default()` to fall back to `user` when the `role` claim is absent.
   ```yaml {paths="jwt-claims"}
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/api-version.md" >}}
   kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}}

         mode: Strict
         providers:
         - issuer: "${KEYCLOAK_ISSUER}"
           jwks:
             remote:
               jwksPath: "${KEYCLOAK_JWKS_PATH}"
               cacheDuration: "5m"
               backendRef:
                 group: ""
                 kind: Service
                 name: keycloak
                 namespace: keycloak
                 port: 8080
       # Copy JWT claims into request headers for the backend
       transformation:
         request:
           set:
           - name: x-user-id
             value: "jwt.sub"
           - name: x-auth-issuer
             value: "jwt.iss"
           - name: x-user-role
             value: "default(jwt.role, 'user')"
   EOF
   ```

   {{< doc-test paths="jwt-claims" >}}
   # WHAT THIS TEST VALIDATES:
   #   * The transformation reads validated JWT claims — x-auth-issuer is set from
   #     jwt.iss, proving the jwt CEL variable is populated before the transformation runs.
   #   * default() falls back correctly — x-user-role is 'user' because the token has no
   #     top-level 'role' claim, exercising default(jwt.role, 'user').
   # WHAT THIS TEST DOES NOT VALIDATE (and why):
   #   * The exact jwt.sub value (x-user-id) — Different layer: the value is a dynamic
   #     Keycloak user UUID, so only issuer/role (deterministic) are asserted.
   #   * The full claim-based routing split (premium vs free backend) — Requires
   #     config/traffic the page omits: real premium-backend / free-backend Services and a
   #     token carrying a 'tier' claim (the default token has none). The Claim-based routing
   #     section instead tests the piece that IS deterministic: a later jwt-claims assertion
   #     confirms the PreRouting transformation derives x-user-tier='free' from default().
   #
   # The visible token block sets ACCESS_TOKEN as a shell variable; export it so that
   # YAMLTest (a child process that interpolates ${ACCESS_TOKEN} from its environment)
   # can read it.
   export ACCESS_TOKEN
   {{< /doc-test >}}

   {{< doc-test paths="jwt-claims" >}}
   YAMLTest -f - <<'EOF'
   - name: validated JWT claims are injected as request headers
     retries: 3
     http:
       url: "http://${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}:80/headers"
       method: GET
       headers:
         host: www.example.com
         authorization: "Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
     source:
       type: local
     expect:
       statusCode: 200
       bodyJsonPath:
         - path: "$.headers.X-Auth-Issuer[0]"
           comparator: contains

           comparator: contains
           value: "user"
   EOF
   {{< /doc-test >}}

2. Using the `ACCESS_TOKEN` that you retrieved in [Verify JWT authentication](#verify-jwt-authentication), send an authenticated request to the httpbin app. Because httpbin echoes back the headers that it receives, you can verify that the claims were injected.
   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -s "${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}:80/headers" -H "host: www.example.com" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" | jq '.headers'
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab name="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -s "http://localhost:8080/headers" -H "host: www.example.com" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" | jq '.headers'
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

   In the response, verify that the `X-User-Id`, `X-Auth-Issuer`, and `X-User-Role` headers contain the values from your JWT claims.
   ```json
   {
     "Accept": ["*/*"],
     "Host": ["www.example.com"],
     "User-Agent": ["curl/8.7.1"],
     "X-Auth-Issuer": ["http://keycloak:8080/realms/master"],
     "X-User-Id": ["a1b2c3d4-..."],
     "X-User-Role": ["user"]
   }
   ```

### Claim-based routing {#claim-based-routing}

You can route requests to different backends based on a JWT claim, such as sending premium and free-tier users to different services. To do this, use a `PreRouting` transformation to copy a claim into a request header, then match on that header in your `HTTPRoute` rules. The `PreRouting` phase runs the transformation before the gateway makes a routing decision, so the header is available for matching. See [PreRouting phase](#prerouting-phase).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This example is illustrative. The following steps show how to derive a routing header from a claim and confirm it is set, but verifying the full premium/free split requires two things that you must configure:
> - **Running `premium-backend` and `free-backend` Services.** Replace them with your own backends, then compare which one handles the request.
> - **A token that carries the `tier` claim.** The default Keycloak master-realm token has no `tier` claim, so every request falls back to `free`. To exercise the premium path, configure a Keycloak client scope or protocol mapper that adds a `tier` claim, then request a token that includes `tier: premium`.

1. Create or update the `jwt-auth-policy` to validate the JWT and, in the `PreRouting` phase, copy a `tier` claim into an `x-user-tier` header. Reusing the same policy name replaces the policy from the previous section, so that only one JWT policy targets the Gateway.
   ```yaml {paths="jwt-claims"}
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/api-version.md" >}}
   kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/policy.md" >}}
   metadata:
     name: jwt-auth-policy
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     targetRefs:
     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
       kind: Gateway
       name: agentgateway-proxy
     traffic:
       phase: PreRouting
       jwtAuthentication:
         mode: Strict
         providers:
         - issuer: "${KEYCLOAK_ISSUER}"
           jwks:
             remote:
               jwksPath: "${KEYCLOAK_JWKS_PATH}"
               cacheDuration: "5m"
               backendRef:
                 group: ""
                 kind: Service
                 name: keycloak
                 namespace: keycloak
                 port: 8080
       transformation:
         request:
           set:
           - name: x-user-tier
             value: "default(jwt.tier, 'free')"
   EOF
   ```

2. Before you add routing rules, confirm that the `PreRouting` transformation derives the `x-user-tier` header from the JWT claim. Send an authenticated request to the httpbin app, which echoes back the headers that it receives. Because the default Keycloak token has no `tier` claim, `default(jwt.tier, 'free')` evaluates to `free`. For local testing with port-forwarding, use `http://localhost:8080/headers` instead.
   ```sh
   curl -s "${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}:80/headers" -H "host: www.example.com" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" | jq '.headers'
   ```

   {{< doc-test paths="jwt-claims" >}}
   YAMLTest -f - <<'EOF'
   - name: PreRouting transformation derives the routing header from the JWT claim
     retries: 3
     http:
       url: "http://${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}:80/headers"
       method: GET
       headers:
         host: www.example.com
         authorization: "Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
     source:
       type: local
     expect:
       statusCode: 200
       bodyJsonPath:
         - path: "$.headers.X-User-Tier[0]"
           comparator: contains
           value: "free"
   EOF
   {{< /doc-test >}}

   In the response, verify that the `X-User-Tier` header is set to `free`.
   ```json
   {
     "Accept": ["*/*"],
     "Host": ["www.example.com"],
     "User-Agent": ["curl/8.7.1"],
     "X-User-Tier": ["free"]
   }
   ```

3. Create an `HTTPRoute` that routes requests to different backends based on the `x-user-tier` header. Requests with `x-user-tier: premium` go to the premium backend, and all other requests fall through to the default backend.
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: tier-routing
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     parentRefs:
     - name: agentgateway-proxy
     hostnames:
     - www.example.com
     rules:
     # Premium users, matched on the header set from the JWT claim
     - matches:
       - headers:
         - name: x-user-tier
           value: premium
       backendRefs:
       - name: premium-backend
         port: 8080
     # All other users
     - backendRefs:
       - name: free-backend
         port: 8080
   EOF
   ```
