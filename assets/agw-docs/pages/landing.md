## Why agentgateway?

Agentgateway is an open source, agentic-native full HTTP and gRPC proxy, not just an “AI sidecar.” You can put microservice APIs and agentic traffic behind one gateway with shared policies, security, and observability.

Traditional API gateways and reverse proxies route HTTP/gRPC well for many cases, but they are not purpose-built for MCP and A2A, and adapting them is not straightforward. These systems are often optimized for stateless, REST-style interactions—one request in, pick a backend, one response out—with no session context or ongoing connection state.

MCP and A2A are fundamentally different, as outlined in the following table.

| Traditional API Gateway | Agentgateway |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Stateless request/response | **Stateful JSON-RPC sessions** with long-lived connections |
| One request → one backend | **Session fan-out** across multiple MCP servers |
| Client-initiated only | **Bidirectional**: servers can push events (SSE) to clients |
| Simple routing by path/header | **Protocol-aware routing** that understands JSON-RPC message bodies |
| Static backend mapping | **Dynamic tool virtualization** on a per-client basis |

### Challenges traditional gateways can't solve

- **Multiplexing & fan-out**: A single client request like "list available tools" needs to fan out across multiple backend MCP servers, aggregate responses, and return a unified result.
- **Server-initiated events**: MCP servers can push real-time updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE) that must be properly routed back through the client session.
- **Protocol negotiation**: Graceful handling of protocol upgrades and fallbacks as MCP/A2A specs evolve.
- **Per-session authorization**: Different clients may have access to different tools, requiring dynamic adjustment of what gets exposed.
- **Tool poisoning protection**: Defense against direct tampering, shadowing, and rug-pull attacks on tools.

### Built for performance

Agentgateway is built in **Rust** because performance and memory safety are non-negotiable for stateful, long-lived connections and fan-out patterns. Every millisecond and megabyte counts when managing concurrent sessions across multiple backend servers.

## Features

Agentgateway is a unified data plane built in Rust for high performance and reliability. It handles HTTP and gRPC routing and policies for everyday APIs, adds first-class support for agent protocols including MCP and A2A, and provides a unified interface for LLM consumption—all in one deployment.

### LLM Gateway

Route traffic to major LLM providers through a **unified OpenAI-compatible API**. Seamlessly switch between providers without changing your application code.

#### OpenAI-compatible providers

Don't see your provider? Many LLMs expose OpenAI-compatible APIs. Agentgateway can route to **any provider** that supports the OpenAI API format, including:

- **Cohere**, **Mistral**, **Groq**, **Together AI**, **Fireworks**{{< version exclude-if="1.0.x,1.1.x,1.2.x,1.3.x,1.4.x,1.5.x,2.2.x" >}}, **Meta**{{< /version >}}{{< version exclude-if="1.0.x,1.1.x,1.2.x,1.3.x,1.4.x,1.5.x,1.6.x,2.2.x" >}}, **Perplexity**{{< /version >}}
- **Ollama**, **LM Studio**, **vLLM**, **llama.cpp** (local models)
- Any custom or self-hosted endpoint with OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`

#### Self-hosted models & Inference routing

Running your own models on GPU infrastructure? Agentgateway implements the [Kubernetes Inference Gateway](https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/) extensions for intelligent routing to local LLM workloads. Route based on:

- **GPU & KV cache utilization** — Send requests to the least-loaded model
- **Prompt criticality** — Prioritize high-priority requests
- **LoRA adapters** — Route to models with specific fine-tuned adapters
- **Work queue depth** — Avoid overloaded inference servers

### MCP Gateway

Connect LLMs to tools and external data sources using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro). Agentgateway provides:

- **Tool federation**: Aggregate multiple MCP servers behind a single endpoint
- **Protocol support**: stdio, HTTP/SSE, and Streamable HTTP transports
- **OpenAPI integration**: Expose existing REST APIs as MCP-native tools
- **Authentication & authorization**: Built-in MCP auth spec compliance with OAuth providers (Auth0, Keycloak)

### A2A Gateway

Enable secure communication between AI agents using the [Agent-to-Agent (A2A)](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A) protocol. Agents can:

- Discover each other's capabilities
- Negotiate interaction modalities (text, forms, media)
- Collaborate on long-running tasks
- Operate without exposing internal state or tools

### Security & Observability

- **Authentication**: JWT, API keys, basic auth, MCP auth spec
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained RBAC with [CEL policy engine](https://cel.dev)
- **Traffic policies**: Rate limiting, CORS, TLS, external authz
- **Observability**: Built-in [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) metrics, logs, and distributed tracing

### Platform Agnostic

Run agentgateway anywhere—bare metal, VMs, containers, or Kubernetes. Conformant to the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) with support for HTTPRoute, GRPCRoute, TCPRoute, and TLSRoute.
