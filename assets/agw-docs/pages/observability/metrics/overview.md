Metrics are numerical measurements collected at regular intervals that describe the state and behavior of a system. In a gateway environment, metrics tell you how many requests are being processed, how long they take, how many fail, how much memory the process uses, and whether the control plane is keeping up with configuration changes. Without metrics, you rely on guesswork to detect problems, diagnose slowdowns, or prove that an issue is resolved.

Agentgateway emits metrics automatically on two separate ports, one for the control plane and one for the data plane. No additional configuration is required to enable them. You can access either endpoint immediately after installation by port-forwarding to the respective pod and sending a request to the `/metrics` path.

| Plane | Component | Default port | Path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Control plane | `deployment/agentgateway` | `9092` | `/metrics` |
| Data plane | Per Gateway, such as the example `deploy/agentgateway-proxy` | `15020` | `/metrics` |

## Access metrics

You can inspect raw metrics directly from either endpoint without installing any monitoring tools.

1. View control plane metrics. 
   1. Port-forward the control plane deployment.
      ```sh
      kubectl port-forward -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} deployment/agentgateway 9092:9092
      ```

   2. Query the metrics endpoint.
      ```sh
      curl http://localhost:9092/metrics
      ```

2. View data plane metrics. 
   1. Port-forward the proxy deployment.
      ```sh
      kubectl port-forward -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} deploy/agentgateway-proxy 15020:15020
      ```
   2. Query the metrics endpoint.
      ```sh
      curl http://localhost:15020/metrics
      ```

Both endpoints return metrics in the [OpenMetrics](https://openmetrics.io/) format. All agentgateway metrics use the `agentgateway_` prefix. For the full list of available metrics, see [Control plane metrics]({{< link path="/documentation/observability/metrics/control-plane/" >}}) and [Data plane metrics]({{< link path="/documentation/observability/metrics/dataplane/" >}}).

## Scrape metrics for querying and visualization

Curling the metrics endpoint gives you a point-in-time snapshot, but it does not let you query metrics across time, set alerts, or see trends. To enable monitoring and alerting on metrics, you typically have an observability tool that scrapes the metrics endpoint on a regular interval and stores the data in a time series database that you can query and graph.

{{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway-capital.md" >}} integrates well with the following tools: 

- **[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)**: An open-source monitoring system that can scrape the `/metrics` endpoints on a regular interval. Metrics are stored as a time series, and you can use PromQL to query them. To scrape metrics from pods with Prometheus, you either add Prometheus-specific scraping annotations to the pod, or use the built-in PodMonitor and ServiceMonitor resources that the {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} Helm chart creates for you when you set `monitoring.enabled` to `true`.
- **[Grafana](https://grafana.com/)**: An open-source visualization platform that connects to Prometheus as a data source and renders dashboards, graphs, and alerts from PromQL queries. {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway-capital.md" >}} ships a pre-built dashboard that covers requests, LLM traffic, MCP traffic, and connections.

The {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} Helm chart includes a `monitoring` section that creates the ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, and Grafana dashboard ConfigMap for you so that you can use Prometheus and Grafana without any additional configuration to monitor the {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} control and data plane. These resources are discovered automatically when you use the [OTel stack]({{< link path="/documentation/observability/otel-stack/" >}}), which configures Prometheus and Grafana to pick them up with no extra setup.

| Resource | Scrape source | Helm section to tune |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ServiceMonitor` | Control plane on port `9092` | `monitoring.serviceMonitor` |
| `PodMonitor` | Proxy pods on port `15020`, selected by GatewayClass name | `monitoring.proxy` |
| `ConfigMap` (Grafana dashboard) | Nothing. Grafana discovers it through the `grafana_dashboard: "1"` label. | `monitoring.grafanaDashboard` |

### Enable control and data plane scraping

Follow the [OTel stack guide]({{< link path="/documentation/observability/otel-stack/" >}}) to install the observability tools, including Prometheus and Grafana, and set `monitoring.enabled=true` to create the ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, and Grafana dashboard ConfigMap. 

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the PodMonitor that the Helm chart creates only scrapes proxy pods in the release namespace and for the `agentgateway` GatewayClass. If you need to scrape proxies in other namespaces or for additional GatewayClasses, see [Scrape additional proxy pods](#other-proxies).

{{< version exclude-if="1.0.x,1.1.x,1.2.x,1.3.x,1.4.x,1.5.x" >}}
The PodMonitor also copies the `gateway.networking.k8s.io/gateway-name` pod label onto the metrics that it scrapes, which is how the built-in Grafana dashboard discovers gateways and filters panels by gateway. If you set your own `monitoring.proxy.podMonitor.podTargetLabels` list, include that label, or the dashboard's gateway selector stays empty.
{{< /version >}}

{{< version exclude-if="1.5.x,1.6.x" >}}
To tune histogram scraping and relabeling, pass histogram and relabeling settings to the ServiceMonitor and PodMonitor that the Helm chart creates. Native histogram scraping requires Prometheus v3.8.0 or later. Native histogram scraping is off by default, and classic histogram scraping is on by default. These Helm values control the Prometheus scrape resources only. The metrics endpoint must also emit native histograms before Prometheus can collect native buckets.

1. Save the monitoring settings in a values file.

   ```yaml
   cat <<'EOF' > monitoring-values.yaml
   monitoring:
     enabled: true
     serviceMonitor:
       scrapeNativeHistograms: true
       scrapeClassicHistograms: true
       relabelings: []
       metricRelabelings: []
     proxy:
       podMonitor:
         scrapeNativeHistograms: true
         scrapeClassicHistograms: true
         relabelings: []
         metricRelabelings: []
   EOF
   ```

   | Value | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | `monitoring.serviceMonitor.scrapeNativeHistograms` | Requests native histogram scraping for control plane metrics. When set to `true`, the chart adds `PrometheusProto` to the ServiceMonitor scrape protocols. |
   | `monitoring.serviceMonitor.scrapeClassicHistograms` | Requests classic bucket histogram scraping for control plane metrics. The default value is `true`. |
   | `monitoring.serviceMonitor.relabelings` | Adds Prometheus Operator relabeling rules before the control plane target is scraped. |
   | `monitoring.serviceMonitor.metricRelabelings` | Adds Prometheus Operator metric relabeling rules before scraped control plane metrics are ingested. |
   | `monitoring.proxy.podMonitor.scrapeNativeHistograms` | Requests native histogram scraping for proxy metrics. When set to `true`, the chart adds `PrometheusProto` to the PodMonitor scrape protocols. |
   | `monitoring.proxy.podMonitor.scrapeClassicHistograms` | Requests classic bucket histogram scraping for proxy metrics. The default value is `true`. |
   | `monitoring.proxy.podMonitor.relabelings` | Adds Prometheus Operator relabeling rules before proxy targets are scraped. |
   | `monitoring.proxy.podMonitor.metricRelabelings` | Adds Prometheus Operator metric relabeling rules before scraped proxy metrics are ingested. |

2. Upgrade the Helm release with the monitoring values.

   ```sh
   helm upgrade -i {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/helm-agentgateway.md" >}} \
     {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/helm-path.md" >}} \
     --namespace {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} \
     --version {{< reuse "agw-docs/versions/helm-version-flag.md" >}} \
     --reuse-values \
     -f monitoring-values.yaml
   ```
{{< /version >}}

### Scrape additional proxy pods {#other-proxies}

The {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} Helm chart creates a single PodMonitor resource in the release namespace when `monitoring.enabled` is set to `true`. By default, the PodMonitor resource only finds proxy pods that are deployed to the same release namespace. Because gateway proxies run in the namespace of the Gateway resource that provisions them, proxies in other namespaces are not scraped automatically. To scape proxy pods in other namespaces, you must use the `namespaceSelector` field. 

**Scrape proxies in all namespaces**: 

To scrape proxy pods in every namespace, set `monitoring.proxy.namespaceSelector` to `any: true` as shown in the following example. 

```yaml
cat <<EOF > monitoring-values.yaml
monitoring:
  enabled: true
  serviceMonitor:
    extraLabels:
      release: kube-prometheus-stack
  proxy:
    namespaceSelector:
      any: true
EOF
```

**Limit the number of proxy namespaces**: 

To scrape proxy pods in specific namespaces only, use a `matchNames` list instead as shown in the following example. 

```yaml
cat <<EOF > monitoring-values.yaml
monitoring:
  enabled: true
  serviceMonitor:
    extraLabels:
      release: kube-prometheus-stack
  proxy:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchNames:
      - agentgateway-system
      - my-other-namespace
EOF
```

**Scrape proxies for specific GatewayClasses**:

By default, the PodMonitor selects proxy pods that belong to the `agentgateway` GatewayClass. If you use multiple GatewayClasses and want to scrape proxy pods for all of them, add each class name to `monitoring.proxy.gatewayClassNames`.

```yaml
cat <<EOF > monitoring-values.yaml
monitoring:
  enabled: true
  serviceMonitor:
    extraLabels:
      release: kube-prometheus-stack
  proxy:
    gatewayClassNames:
    - agentgateway
    - my-other-gatewayclass
EOF
```

### Grafana dashboard discovery across namespaces

When you install the `kube-prometheus-stack` Helm chart, Grafana is deployed as a pod with three containers: `grafana`, `grafana-sc-datasources`, and `grafana-sc-dashboard`. The `grafana-sc-dashboard` container is a sidecar from the [`kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar`](https://github.com/kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar) image that is bundled with the Grafana Helm chart. It watches the Kubernetes API for ConfigMaps that carry the `grafana_dashboard: "1"` label and automatically copies their JSON content into the Grafana pod's dashboard directory, where Grafana's file-based provisioner picks it up. No separate installation or Grafana restart is needed to see these dashboards.

By default, the sidecar only watches the namespace where Grafana is installed. If the ConfigMap for the {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} dashboard is in a different namespace, the sidecar does not discover it and the dashboard does not appear in Grafana.

To allow the sidecar to find ConfigMaps in all namespaces, set `sidecar.dashboards.searchNamespace` to `ALL` when installing or upgrading the `kube-prometheus-stack` chart. 

```sh
helm upgrade kube-prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  -n monitoring \
  --reuse-values \
  --set grafana.sidecar.dashboards.searchNamespace=ALL
```

To restrict discovery to specific namespaces, pass a comma-separated list of namespace names instead of `ALL`:

```sh
helm upgrade kube-prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  -n monitoring \
  --reuse-values \
  --set grafana.sidecar.dashboards.searchNamespace="monitoring,agentgateway-system"
```
