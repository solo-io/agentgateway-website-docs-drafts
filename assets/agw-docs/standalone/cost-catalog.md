Agentgateway can track LLM spend by mapping each request's provider, model, and token counts to per-token pricing.

Agentgateway extracts token usage from supported LLM APIs automatically. To convert those token counts into cost, configure a model cost catalog. The catalog maps provider and model names to pricing data so agentgateway can attach realized USD cost to logs, traces, metrics, and CEL expressions.

{{< version exclude-if="1.5.x" >}}For document and optical character recognition (OCR) models that report page usage, the catalog can also price each processed page.{{< /version >}}

> [!NOTE]
> Cost analysis is best-effort and may not exactly match your provider bill in scenarios such as price changes, custom pricing, failed requests, or provider-specific billing rules.

## Configure a model catalog

Use `config.modelCatalog` to load one or more model cost catalog files. Catalog entries are merged in order, and later entries take precedence. This lets you start with an imported public catalog and then layer local overrides for contracted pricing, internal models, or provider-specific aliases.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config

config:
  modelCatalog:
  - file: ./costs/catalog.json

llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: openAI
    params:
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

Run agentgateway with the config file.

```sh
agentgateway -f config.yaml
```

After the catalog is loaded, priced requests include cost data. The access log includes `agw.ai.usage.cost.total`, and CEL exposes cost data as `llm.cost` and `llm.costRates`.

For general LLM telemetry setup, see [Observe traffic]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/observability/" >}}).

## Import costs (agctl)

<!-- The merged `--source` list is new in 1.6. Every gate in this file must keep
     include/exclude as a complete, matching pair — shortening either to "1.5.x"
     would also match 1.4.x and older, and adding "main" would need an edit every
     release. -->
Use `agctl {{< reuse "agw-docs/versions/agctl-catalog-cmd.md" >}} import` to generate a catalog file. {{< version include-if="1.0.x,1.1.x,1.2.x,1.3.x,1.4.x,1.5.x,2.2.x" >}}The command reads from a supported pricing source, and the default source is `models.dev`.{{< /version >}}{{< version exclude-if="1.0.x,1.1.x,1.2.x,1.3.x,1.4.x,1.5.x,2.2.x" >}}The `--source` flag takes a comma-separated list, and the sources merge in the order that you list them, so a later source overlays an earlier one. The default is `models.dev,aws-bedrock-mantle`, which prices every provider that the proxy supports and then tags the Amazon Bedrock models.{{< /version >}}

{{% version exclude-if="1.0.x,1.1.x,1.2.x,1.3.x,1.4.x,1.5.x,2.2.x" %}}
A source is a catalog to import from, not an LLM provider: each source covers one or more providers and contributes rates, tags, or both. Use `--providers` to import a subset of the providers that a source covers.

| Source | What it contributes |
|--------|---------------------|
| `models.dev` | Rates for every provider that the proxy supports, from [models.dev](https://models.dev). |
| `aws-bedrock-mantle` | Tags for Amazon Bedrock models only, read from the AWS model cards. This source contributes no rates. The tags record which endpoint serves a model, `runtime` or `mantle`, and which request formats the Mantle endpoint accepts. |
| `github` | The curated catalog that the agentgateway project publishes at [agentgateway.dev/model-catalog](https://agentgateway.dev/model-catalog), which covers the models that the agentgateway project tracks rather than everything that models.dev lists. Not imported by default. |
{{% /version %}}

```sh
mkdir -p costs
agctl {{< reuse "agw-docs/versions/agctl-catalog-cmd.md" >}} import --out ./costs/catalog.json
```

To keep the catalog smaller, import only the providers that you use. {{< version include-if="1.0.x,1.1.x,1.2.x,1.3.x,1.4.x,1.5.x,2.2.x" >}}The following provider IDs are the same in both sources.{{< /version >}}{{< version exclude-if="1.0.x,1.1.x,1.2.x,1.3.x,1.4.x,1.5.x,2.2.x" >}}The following provider IDs are the same in the `models.dev` and `github` sources.{{< /version >}}

```sh
agctl {{< reuse "agw-docs/versions/agctl-catalog-cmd.md" >}} import \
  --providers anthropic,mistral,openai \
  --out ./costs/catalog.json
```

{{< version exclude-if="1.0.x,1.1.x,1.2.x,1.3.x,1.4.x,1.5.x,2.2.x" >}}
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `--providers` flag takes the provider IDs of the source that you import from, and the sources name some providers differently. The `github` source uses the agentgateway provider IDs, such as `gcp.gemini` and `aws.bedrock`, while `models.dev` uses its own IDs, such as `google` and `amazon-bedrock`. An ID that the source does not recognize is handled differently too: `models.dev` fails with `no providers matched`, but `github` reports `imported 0 providers` and writes a catalog without that provider. A `--providers` list that omits Bedrock also makes `aws-bedrock-mantle` contribute nothing. Check the provider list in the generated file before you load it.
{{< /version >}}

For all flags, see the {{< version include-if="1.3.x,1.2.x,1.1.x,1.0.x,2.2.x" >}}[`agctl costs import`]({{< link-hextra path="/reference/agctl/agctl-costs-import/" >}}){{< /version >}}{{< version exclude-if="1.3.x,1.2.x,1.1.x,1.0.x,2.2.x" >}}[`agctl catalog import`]({{< link-hextra path="/reference/agctl/agctl-catalog-import/" >}}){{< /version >}} reference.

## Import costs (UI)

You can also manage the model cost catalog from the built-in [UI]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/setup/ui/" >}}).

1. Open the [UI cost page](http://localhost:15000/ui/llm/costs) (**LLM > Costs**). The page lists your configured **Catalog sources** (files and ConfigMaps, merged in order) and any inline **Custom costs** overrides.

   {{< reuse-image-light src="img/ui-cost-catalog.png" alt="UI LLM Costs page showing catalog sources and custom cost overrides" >}}
   {{< reuse-image-dark srcDark="img/ui-cost-catalog-dark.png" alt="UI LLM Costs page showing catalog sources and custom cost overrides" >}}

2. Press **Refresh base costs**. The UI fetches the latest base costs and configures `modelCatalog`. You can refresh again later to pull updated pricing and model data.

3. To adjust pricing for a specific model, use **Edit** under **Custom costs** to add inline overrides without changing your catalog files.

When you set up a fresh configuration for the first time, the UI automatically performs the refresh step.

After you load a catalog, the same UI visualizes your priced traffic. For more information, see [Cost dashboard]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/cost-controls/dashboard/" >}}).

## Override catalog entries

If your provider pricing differs from the imported public catalog, add another catalog file after the imported one. Later catalog sources override earlier sources.

```yaml
config:
  modelCatalog:
  - file: ./costs/catalog.json
  - file: ./costs/overrides.json
```

Use overrides for contracted pricing, internally hosted models, or models that do not appear in the imported catalog.

{{% version include-if="1.3.x,1.2.x,1.1.x,1.0.x,2.2.x" %}}
You can also load one or more catalog files with the `MODEL_CATALOG_PATHS` environment variable. Set it to a comma-separated list of file paths.

```sh
MODEL_CATALOG_PATHS=./costs/catalog.json,./costs/overrides.json agentgateway -f config.yaml
```

> [!WARNING]
> When `MODEL_CATALOG_PATHS` is set, it replaces any `config.modelCatalog` sources. Use one mechanism or the other.
{{% /version %}}

{{% version exclude-if="1.3.x,1.2.x,1.1.x,1.0.x,2.2.x" %}}
> [!WARNING]
> The `MODEL_CATALOG_PATHS` environment variable is removed. Agentgateway ignores it without an error, so a catalog that you loaded this way stops applying. List your catalog files under `config.modelCatalog` instead.
{{% /version %}}

## Use cost data

When a request matches an entry in the catalog, agentgateway populates these CEL fields:

- `llm.cost`: The realized USD cost of the request. Includes `total` plus per-token-type components such as `input`, `output`, `cacheRead`, `cacheWrite`, `reasoning`, `inputAudio`, and `outputAudio`. Unset when the model cannot be priced.
- `llm.costRates`: The effective USD-per-1,000,000-token rates that were applied. Includes the same per-token-type fields when available. Unset when the model cannot be priced.

{{< version exclude-if="1.5.x" >}}For page-billed document models, `llm.cost.pages` reports the page-cost component, and `llm.costRates.perPage` reports the USD-per-page rate that was applied.{{< /version >}}

The request access log always includes `agw.ai.usage.cost.total` for LLM requests when a cost is available.
Traces always include the full breakdown:
* `agw.ai.usage.cost.total`
* `agw.ai.usage.cost.input`
* `agw.ai.usage.cost.output`
* `agw.ai.usage.cost.cache_read`
* `agw.ai.usage.cost.cache_write`
* `agw.ai.usage.cost.reasoning`
* `agw.ai.usage.cost.input_audio`
* `agw.ai.usage.cost.output_audio`
{{< version exclude-if="1.5.x" >}}* `agw.ai.usage.cost.pages`{{< /version >}}

As these are loaded into the CEL context, they can be explicitly emited as well.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
frontendPolicies:
  accessLog:
    add:
       # Add the input cost
       input_cost: llm.cost.input
       # Add ALL cost variables, as `cost.input`, `cost.output`, etc.
       cost: flatten(llm.cost)
```

A priced request produces an access log entry that includes cost data.

```console
... protocol=llm gen_ai.provider.name=openai gen_ai.request.model=gpt-4o-mini
gen_ai.usage.input_tokens=14 gen_ai.usage.output_tokens=6 agw.ai.usage.cost.total=0.0000057 ...
```

## Monitor catalog lookups

Every cost lookup increments the `agentgateway_cost_catalog_lookups_total` counter. The metric is labeled with lookup `status`, provider, request model, and response model.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Exact` | The provider and model were found in the catalog and priced. |
| `Unpriced` | The model was found, but the token types in the request had no matching rates. |
| `Missing` | The provider or model was not found in the catalog. |
| `NoCatalog` | No catalog is configured. |

A rising `Missing` or `Unpriced` count means requests are flowing through models that your catalog does not price. Add the missing providers or models to your catalog and reload.

> [!NOTE]
> In traces, the corresponding cost-resolution `status` attribute uses lowercase values: `exact`, `unpriced`, `missing`, and `noCatalog`.

## Enforce budgets

The model catalog provides pricing data for spend visibility. To block or throttle traffic, combine cost visibility with rate limiting or virtual key management.

- Use [Rate limiting]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/configuration/resiliency/rate-limits/" >}}) to cap request or token usage per route, user, or API key.
- Use [Virtual keys]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/cost-controls/virtual-keys/" >}}) to issue keys with per-key controls and attribution.

## Advanced: Catalog format

Usually, you do not need to write catalog JSON by hand. Use `agctl {{< reuse "agw-docs/versions/agctl-catalog-cmd.md" >}} import` or the UI to generate the base catalog, then add overrides only when needed.

{{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/model-catalog-json-format.md" >}}
