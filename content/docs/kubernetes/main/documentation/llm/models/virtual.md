Publish one client-facing model name and route requests across several models.

## About

A virtual model is an `{{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgatewaymodel.md" >}}` that sets `spec.virtualModel` instead of `spec.provider`. A virtual model has no provider of its own. Instead, it selects a concrete `{{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgatewaymodel.md" >}}` at request time.

Virtual models let you change which model serves a request without asking clients to change the model name they send. Use them to split traffic during a migration, fail over when a provider degrades, or pick a model based on request context.

Three routing strategies are available, and each virtual model uses exactly one of them.

| Strategy | Selects a target by | Use it for |
|----------|---------------------|------------|
| `weighted` | Relative weight. | Traffic splitting, canary rollouts, and A/B tests. |
| `failover` | Priority group, then health and latency. | Resiliency when a provider degrades. |
| `conditional` | The first CEL expression that evaluates to `true`. | Tiering by header, body, or other request context. |

Targets are usually `Internal` models, so clients cannot request them directly and they stay out of `/v1/models`. For more on visibility, see [About models]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/models/about/" >}}).

If one target does not resolve, the control plane still generates the virtual model with the targets that can resolve. The `{{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgatewaymodel.md" >}}` reports `ResolvedRefs: False` with `reason: Invalid`. Valid targets can still serve requests. If weighted routing selects an invalid target, the request fails with `virtual_model_target_not_found`. If conditional routing matches an invalid target, the request also fails instead of falling through to another target. Failover omits invalid targets from the active provider groups.

> [!NOTE]
> Virtual models must be `Public`, and they cannot set `spec.policies`. Configure policies on the concrete target models instead.

## Before you begin

1. Complete [Serve a model]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/models/serve/" >}}). This guide reuses the `agentgateway-proxy` Gateway and the httpbun mock LLM from that guide, and assumes that the `{{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgatewaymodel.md" >}}` API is enabled.
2. Save the gateway address in an environment variable.

   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   export INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS=$(kubectl get svc -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} agentgateway-proxy -o=jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0]['hostname','ip']}")
   echo $INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab name="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   Use this option if your cluster does not assign an external IP to `LoadBalancer` services, such as a default Kind cluster.

   ```sh
   kubectl port-forward deployment/agentgateway-proxy -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} 8080:80
   ```

   In a separate terminal, point the requests in this guide at the forwarded port.

   ```sh
   export INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS=localhost:8080
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

## Create the target models

1. Create two internal models to route between. Each rewrites the `model` field to a distinct value so that you can tell from the response which target served the request.

   ```yaml {paths="virtual-models"}
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: agentgateway.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgatewaymodel.md" >}}
   metadata:
     name: internal-fast
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     parentRefs:
     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
       kind: Gateway
       name: agentgateway-proxy
       sectionName: http
     visibility: Internal
     provider: OpenAI
     baseURL: http://httpbun.default.svc.cluster.local:3090/llm
     policies:
       transformations:
       - field: model
         expression: '"resolved-internal-fast"'
   ---
   apiVersion: agentgateway.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgatewaymodel.md" >}}
   metadata:
     name: internal-premium
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     parentRefs:
     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
       kind: Gateway
       name: agentgateway-proxy
       sectionName: http
     visibility: Internal
     provider: OpenAI
     baseURL: http://httpbun.default.svc.cluster.local:3090/llm
     policies:
       transformations:
       - field: model
         expression: '"resolved-internal-premium"'
   EOF
   ```

2. Verify that neither model can be requested directly. Because both models set `visibility: Internal`, a direct request returns an error.

   ```sh
   curl -s -X POST http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model": "internal-fast", "messages": []}'
   ```

   Example output:

   ```json
   {"error":{"message":"Model not found","type":"invalid_request_error","code":"model_not_found"}}
   ```

   {{< doc-test paths="virtual-models" >}}
   YAMLTest -f - <<'EOF'
   - name: internal models cannot be requested directly
     http:
       url: "http://${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}/v1/chat/completions"
       method: POST
       headers:
         Content-Type: application/json
       body: |
         {"model": "internal-fast", "messages": []}
     source:
       type: local
     retries: 3
     expect:
       statusCode: 404
       bodyJsonPath:
         - path: "$.error.code"
           comparator: equals
           value: "model_not_found"
   EOF
   {{< /doc-test >}}

## Split traffic with weighted routing

Use `virtualModel.weighted` to distribute requests across targets by relative weight.

1. Create a virtual model that sends 80% of requests to `internal-fast` and 20% to `internal-premium`.

   ```yaml {paths="virtual-models"}
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: agentgateway.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgatewaymodel.md" >}}
   metadata:
     name: balanced
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     parentRefs:
     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
       kind: Gateway
       name: agentgateway-proxy
       sectionName: http
     virtualModel:
       weighted:
         targets:
         - modelRef:
             name: internal-fast
           weight: 80
         - modelRef:
             name: internal-premium
           weight: 20
   EOF
   ```

   {{% reuse "agw-docs/snippets/review-table.md" %}} For more information, see the [API docs]({{< link-hextra path="/reference/api/#agentgatewaymodelspec" >}}).

   | Field | Value | Description |
   |-------|-------|-------------|
   | `targets[].modelRef.name` | `internal-fast` | An `{{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgatewaymodel.md" >}}` in the same namespace. Cross-namespace references are not supported. |
   | `targets[].weight` | `80` | Relative weight, not a percentage. Weights are normalized across targets. Defaults to `1`. |

   > [!NOTE]
   > When `modelRef` points to a model with a wildcard `match.model`, also set `targets[].model` to the concrete name to request through it, such as `openai/gpt-5-mini`. Otherwise, the target's exact `match.model` value is used.

2. Send several requests and count which target served each one.

   ```sh
   for i in $(seq 60); do
     curl -s -X POST http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS/v1/chat/completions \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"model": "balanced", "messages": [], "httpbun": {"content": "hi"}}' \
       | grep -o '"model":"[^"]*"'
   done | sort | uniq -c
   ```

   Example output. The exact split varies between runs, and it converges on 80/20 as the number of requests grows.

   ```
     46 "model":"resolved-internal-fast"
     14 "model":"resolved-internal-premium"
   ```

   {{< doc-test paths="virtual-models" >}}
   for i in $(seq 1 60); do
     curl -s --max-time 5 -o /dev/null -X POST "http://${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}/v1/chat/completions" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"model":"balanced","messages":[],"httpbun":{"content":"warmup"}}' && break
     sleep 2
   done

   YAMLTest -f - <<'EOF'
   - name: weighted virtual model resolves to one of its targets
     http:
       url: "http://${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}/v1/chat/completions"
       method: POST
       headers:
         Content-Type: application/json
       body: |
         {"model": "balanced", "messages": [], "httpbun": {"content": "hi"}}
     source:
       type: local
     retries: 3
     expect:
       statusCode: 200
       bodyJsonPath:
         - path: "$.model"
           comparator: contains
           value: "resolved-internal-"
   EOF
   {{< /doc-test >}}

## Choose a model by request context

Use `virtualModel.conditional` to select a target with a CEL expression. Targets are evaluated in order, and the first match wins.

1. Create a virtual model that routes premium clients to `internal-premium` and everyone else to `internal-fast`.

   ```yaml {paths="virtual-models"}
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: agentgateway.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgatewaymodel.md" >}}
   metadata:
     name: smart
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     parentRefs:
     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
       kind: Gateway
       name: agentgateway-proxy
       sectionName: http
     virtualModel:
       conditional:
         targets:
         - when: 'request.headers["x-model-tier"] == "premium"'
           modelRef:
             name: internal-premium
         - modelRef:
             name: internal-fast
   EOF
   ```

   {{% reuse "agw-docs/snippets/review-table.md" %}} For more information, see the [API docs]({{< link-hextra path="/reference/api/#agentgatewaymodelspec" >}}).

   | Field | Value | Description |
   |-------|-------|-------------|
   | `targets[].when` | `request.headers["x-model-tier"] == "premium"` | A CEL expression that must evaluate to `true` for the target to be selected. For the fields you can use, see the [CEL reference]({{< link-hextra path="/reference/cel/" >}}). |
   | `targets[1]` | No `when` field | The fallback. Only one target can omit `when`, and it must be last. Without a fallback, a request that matches no condition fails. |

2. Send a request with the premium header.

   ```sh
   curl -s -X POST http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "x-model-tier: premium" \
     -d '{"model": "smart", "messages": [], "httpbun": {"content": "hi"}}'
   ```

   Example output:

   ```json
   {"model":"resolved-internal-premium","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":1,"total_tokens":1},"choices":[{"message":{"content":"hi","role":"assistant"},"finish_reason":"stop","index":0}],"object":"chat.completion"}
   ```

   {{< doc-test paths="virtual-models" >}}
   for i in $(seq 1 60); do
     curl -s --max-time 5 -o /dev/null -X POST "http://${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}/v1/chat/completions" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "x-model-tier: premium" \
       -d '{"model":"smart","messages":[],"httpbun":{"content":"warmup"}}' && break
     sleep 2
   done

   YAMLTest -f - <<'EOF'
   - name: conditional routing selects the premium target on a matching header
     http:
       url: "http://${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}/v1/chat/completions"
       method: POST
       headers:
         Content-Type: application/json
         x-model-tier: premium
       body: |
         {"model": "smart", "messages": [], "httpbun": {"content": "hi"}}
     source:
       type: local
     retries: 3
     expect:
       statusCode: 200
       bodyJsonPath:
         - path: "$.model"
           comparator: equals
           value: "resolved-internal-premium"
   EOF
   {{< /doc-test >}}

3. Send a request without the header. The fallback target serves it.

   ```sh
   curl -s -X POST http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model": "smart", "messages": [], "httpbun": {"content": "hi"}}'
   ```

   Example output:

   ```json
   {"model":"resolved-internal-fast","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":1,"total_tokens":1},"choices":[{"message":{"content":"hi","role":"assistant"},"finish_reason":"stop","index":0}],"object":"chat.completion"}
   ```

   {{< doc-test paths="virtual-models" >}}
   YAMLTest -f - <<'EOF'
   - name: conditional routing falls back when no condition matches
     http:
       url: "http://${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}/v1/chat/completions"
       method: POST
       headers:
         Content-Type: application/json
       body: |
         {"model": "smart", "messages": [], "httpbun": {"content": "hi"}}
     source:
       type: local
     retries: 3
     expect:
       statusCode: 200
       bodyJsonPath:
         - path: "$.model"
           comparator: equals
           value: "resolved-internal-fast"
   EOF
   {{< /doc-test >}}

## Fail over when a model degrades

Use `virtualModel.failover` to group targets by priority. Lower values are preferred. Targets in the same priority group are selected by a score that considers health and latency. The next group is used only when every target in the current group is degraded.

Failover depends on eviction. Configure `policies.health` on the concrete target models to define when a target is evicted. Without a health policy, targets are never evicted and failover does not occur.

1. Create a model that points at an address with no backing workload, so that requests to it always fail. In a real deployment, the target would be a healthy primary provider.

   ```yaml {paths="virtual-models"}
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: unreachable-llm
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     selector:
       app: does-not-exist
     ports:
     - port: 9235
       targetPort: 9235
   ---
   apiVersion: agentgateway.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgatewaymodel.md" >}}
   metadata:
     name: primary-down
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     parentRefs:
     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
       kind: Gateway
       name: agentgateway-proxy
       sectionName: http
     visibility: Internal
     provider: OpenAI
     baseURL: http://unreachable-llm.{{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}.svc.cluster.local:9235
     policies:
       health:
         eviction:
           consecutiveFailures: 1
   EOF
   ```

   {{% reuse "agw-docs/snippets/review-table.md" %}}

   | Field | Value | Description |
   |-------|-------|-------------|
   | `policies.health.eviction.consecutiveFailures` | `1` | Evicts the target after a single failure. Production values are typically higher. Use `policies.health.unhealthyCondition` to also treat specific responses, such as `response.code >= 500`, as failures. |

2. Create a virtual model that prefers `primary-down` and falls back to `internal-fast`.

   ```yaml {paths="virtual-models"}
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: agentgateway.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgatewaymodel.md" >}}
   metadata:
     name: resilient
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     parentRefs:
     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
       kind: Gateway
       name: agentgateway-proxy
       sectionName: http
     virtualModel:
       failover:
         targets:
         - modelRef:
             name: primary-down
           priority: 0
         - modelRef:
             name: internal-fast
           priority: 1
   EOF
   ```

   {{% reuse "agw-docs/snippets/review-table.md" %}}

   | Field | Value | Description |
   |-------|-------|-------------|
   | `targets[].priority` | `0` | Lower values are preferred. Give several targets the same priority to load balance across them within a group. |

3. Send three requests in a row.

   ```sh
   for i in 1 2 3; do
     curl -s -X POST http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS/v1/chat/completions \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"model": "resilient", "messages": [], "httpbun": {"content": "hi"}}'
     echo
   done
   ```

   Example output. The first request fails and evicts `primary-down`. Later requests are served by the priority 1 target.

   ```
   upstream call failed: Connect: Connection refused (os error 111)
   {"model":"resolved-internal-fast","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":1,"total_tokens":1},"choices":[{"message":{"content":"hi","role":"assistant"},"finish_reason":"stop","index":0}],"object":"chat.completion"}
   {"model":"resolved-internal-fast","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":1,"total_tokens":1},"choices":[{"message":{"content":"hi","role":"assistant"},"finish_reason":"stop","index":0}],"object":"chat.completion"}
   ```

   {{< doc-test paths="virtual-models" >}}
   # Wait until the virtual model is served at all. The priority 0 target is
   # unreachable, so this request is expected to fail; only the fact that the
   # gateway answers matters here.
   for i in $(seq 1 60); do
     curl -s --max-time 5 -o /dev/null -X POST "http://${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}/v1/chat/completions" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"model":"resilient","messages":[],"httpbun":{"content":"warmup"}}' && break
     sleep 2
   done

   # This request evicts the unreachable priority 0 target. It fails by design,
   # so it is not asserted.
   curl -s -o /dev/null -X POST "http://${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}/v1/chat/completions" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model":"resilient","messages":[],"httpbun":{"content":"trigger"}}'

   sleep 2

   YAMLTest -f - <<'EOF'

           comparator: equals
           value: "resolved-internal-fast"
   EOF
   {{< /doc-test >}}

   > [!WARNING]
   > Failover is not a per-request retry. The request that triggers eviction still fails and returns an error to the client, and only later requests route to the next priority group.

## Verify model discovery

Only the virtual models appear in discovery. The internal targets are hidden.

```sh
curl -s http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS/v1/models
```

Example output:

```json

    {"id": "balanced", "object": "model", "created": 1785166485, "owned_by": "openai"},

    {"id": "smart", "object": "model", "created": 1785166485, "owned_by": "openai"}
  ],
  "object": "list"
}
```

# reach the virtual model IDs. Grep the response so we can verify every virtual
# model is listed and that the Internal targets stay hidden.
for i in $(seq 1 30); do
  models=$(curl -s "http://${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}/v1/models")
  if echo "$models" | grep -q '"balanced"' && echo "$models" | grep -q '"resilient"' && echo "$models" | grep -q '"smart"'; then break; fi
  sleep 2
done
echo "$models"
echo "$models" | grep -q '"balanced"'
echo "$models" | grep -q '"resilient"'
echo "$models" | grep -q '"smart"'
if echo "$models" | grep -qE '"(internal-fast|internal-premium|primary-down|unreachable-llm)"'; then
  echo "ERROR: an Internal model target appeared in /v1/models"; exit 1
fi

## Cleanup

```sh
kubectl delete agentgatewaymodel balanced smart resilient internal-fast internal-premium primary-down -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
kubectl delete service unreachable-llm -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
```
