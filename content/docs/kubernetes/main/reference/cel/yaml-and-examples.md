## CEL in YAML

When writing CEL expressions in agentgateway, typically they are expressed as YAML string values, which can cause confusion.
Any string literals within the expression need to be escaped with additional quotes.

These examples all represent the same CEL expression, a string literal `"hello"`.

```yaml
doubleQuote: "'hello'"
doubleQuoteEscaped: "\"hello\""
singleQuote: '"hello"'
blockSingle: |
  'hello'
blockDouble: |
  "hello"
```

These examples all represent the same CEL expression, a variable `request`:

```yaml
doubleQuote: "request"
singleQuote: 'request'
block: |
  request
```

The `block` style is often the most readable for complex expressions, and also allows for multi-line expressions without needing to escape quotes.

## Example expressions

Review the following examples of expressions for different use cases.

### Default function {#default-function}

You can use the `default` function to provide a fallback value if the expression cannot be resolved.

Request header fallback with example of an anonymous user:

```
default(request.headers["x-user-id"], "anonymous")
```

Nested object fallback with example of light theme:

```
default(json(request.body).user.preferences.theme, "light")
```

{{< gloss "JWT (JSON Web Token)" >}}JWT{{< /gloss >}} claim fallback with example of default "user" role:

```
default(jwt.role, "user")
```

### Logs, traces, and observability {#logs}

```yaml
# Include logs where there was no response or there was an error
filter: |
   !has(response) || response.code > 299
fields:
  add:
    user.agent: 'request.headers["user-agent"]'
    # A static string. Note the expression is a string, and it returns a string, hence the double quotes.
    span.name: '"openai.chat"'
    # Cache-inclusive and consistent across providers. For the provider's own
    # count, use 'llm.providerInputTokens' instead.
    gen_ai.usage.prompt_tokens: 'llm.inputTokens'
    # Parse the JSON request body, and conditionally log...
    # * If `type` is sum, val1+val2
    # * Else, val3
    # Example JSON request: `{"type":"sum","val1":2,"val2":3,"val4":"hello"}`
    json.field: |
      json(request.body).with(b,
         b.type == "sum" ?
           b.val1 + b.val2 :
           b.val3
      )

```

### Authorization {#authorization}

```yaml
mcpAuthorization:
  rules:
  # Allow anyone to call 'echo'
  - 'mcp.tool.name == "echo"'
  # Allow anyone to list tools, but let only test-user call tools
  - 'mcp.methodName == "tools/list" || (mcp.methodName == "tools/call" && jwt.sub == "test-user")'
  # Only the test-user can call 'add'
  - 'jwt.sub == "test-user" && mcp.tool.name == "add"'
  # Any authenticated user with the claim `nested.key == value` can access 'printEnv'
  - 'mcp.tool.name == "printEnv" && jwt.nested.key == "value"'
```

### Rate limiting {#rate-limiting}

```yaml
remoteRateLimit:
   descriptors:
   # Rate limit requests based on a header, whether the user is authenticated, and a static value (used to match a specific rate limit rule on the rate limit server)
   - entries:
      - key: some-static-value
        value: '"something"'
      - key: organization
        value: 'request.headers["x-organization"]'
      - key: authenticated
        value: 'has(jwt.sub)'
```
