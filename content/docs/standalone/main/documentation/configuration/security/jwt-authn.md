{{< gloss "JWT (JSON Web Token)" >}}JWT tokens{{< /gloss >}} from incoming requests can be verified.

JWT authentication requires a few parameters:

* The **issuer** verifies that tokens come from the specified issuer (`iss`). Agentgateway rejects a token from another issuer, and it also rejects a token that has no `iss` claim.
* The **audiences** lists allowed audience values (`aud`). The token's `aud` claim must contain at least one of these values. Omit the field to accept any audience. An empty list also accepts any audience, and a non-empty list rejects a token that has no `aud` claim.
* The **jwks** defines the list of public keys to verify against.

When more than one JWT issuer configuration applies to a request, agentgateway selects the provider by the token's `iss` claim and `kid` header. Then, agentgateway verifies the signature and claims. This selection lets multiple issuers publish the same `kid` value without validating a token against the wrong provider.

If a token includes a not-before claim (`nbf`), agentgateway rejects the token when the `nbf` value is more than 60 seconds in the future. The `nbf` claim is optional by default. To require it, add `nbf` to `requiredClaims`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In version 1.4 and earlier, a configured issuer matched only when the `iss` claim was present, and a non-empty `audiences` list matched only when the `aud` claim was present. A token that omitted the claim passed. From version 1.5, each claim is required, so a token that omits it is rejected. Setting `requiredClaims: []` does not restore the earlier behavior, because it removes only the claim requirements that you add yourself, not the ones that the configured `issuer` and `audiences` imply. If a client sends tokens without an `aud` claim, remove the `audiences` field instead of emptying `requiredClaims`.

Additionally, authentication can run in three different modes:
* **Strict**: A valid token, issued by a configured issuer, must be present.
* **Optional** (default): If a token exists, validate it.  
  *Warning*: This allows requests without a JWT token!
* **Permissive**: Requests are never rejected. This is useful for usage of claims in later steps (authorization, logging, etc).  
  *Warning*: This allows requests without a JWT token!

After it validates a token, agentgateway removes the token from the location that it was read from, so that the backend never receives the client's credential. Two settings change that.

* Set `preserveToken: true` on the `jwtAuth` policy to leave the validated token where it was found. Use this setting when another policy on the same route reads the token from the request, such as an [OAuth token exchange]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/configuration/security/backend-authn/token-exchange/standard/" >}}) that takes it as the subject token.
* Set the `passthrough` [backend authentication]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/configuration/security/backend-authn/" >}}) method to forward the validated token to one backend. Prefer this form when only the backend needs the token, because it does not expose the credential to every policy that runs later.

It is common to pair `jwtAuth` with `authorization`, using the `claims` from the verified JWT.
