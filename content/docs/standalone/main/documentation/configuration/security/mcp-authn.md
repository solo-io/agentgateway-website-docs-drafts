MCP authentication enables OAuth 2.0 protection for MCP servers, helping to implement the [MCP Authorization specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization). Agentgateway can act as a resource server, validating JWT tokens and exposing protected resource metadata.

MCP authentication is configured at the route level under `policies.mcpAuthentication`. Because the policy runs at the route level, you can use JWT claims from MCP auth in other route-level policies, such as authorization, rate limiting, and transformations.

MCP authentication uses a connect-time model, sometimes called *eager auth*: the OAuth flow happens once when the client first connects, not on each tool call. After the initial authentication, the access token is reused for all subsequent requests within the session.

## Authorization Server Proxy

Agentgateway can adapt traffic for authorization servers that don't fully comply with OAuth standards.
For example, Keycloak exposes certificates at a non-standard endpoint.

Set the `provider` field to adapt agentgateway's behavior to a specific authorization server.

In this mode, agentgateway:
- Exposes protected resource metadata on behalf of the MCP server
- Proxies authorization server metadata and client registration
- Validates tokens using the authorization server's JWKS
- Returns `401 Unauthorized` with appropriate `WWW-Authenticate` headers for unauthenticated requests

### Supported providers {#providers}

The `provider` field takes a map with a single provider key, such as `provider: {keycloak: {}}`. Each provider adapts agentgateway to the behavior of that authorization server, including where it publishes signing keys and how it handles Dynamic Client Registration (DCR).

Other identity providers that fully comply with the OAuth 2.0 specifications might also work, but are not tested. For an end-to-end setup guide for each tested provider, see the [Authentication & Identity]({{< link-hextra path="/integrations/auth/" >}}) section.

| `provider` | Derived JWKS URL | Metadata source | Notable behavior |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| [`auth0`]({{< link-hextra path="/integrations/auth/auth0" >}})  | {issuer}/.well-known/jwks.json | RFC 8414 | Appends the first audience to the authorization endpoint, because Auth0 does not support RFC 8707. |
| [`authentik`]({{< link-hextra path="/integrations/auth/authentik" >}}) | {issuer}/jwks/ | OIDC discovery | Injects a DCR endpoint, because open source authentik does not implement RFC 7591. Requires `clientId`. |
| [`descope`]({{< link-hextra path="/integrations/auth/descope" >}}) | https://api.descope.com/{project-id}/.well-known/jwks.json | OIDC discovery | Rewrites agentic issuers to the project-level JWKS URL. `clientId` recommended, because DCR requires a management key. |
| [`entra`]({{< link-hextra path="/integrations/auth/entra" >}}) | Derived from the tenant's v2.0 discovery document | Entra v2.0 discovery | Strips the RFC 8707 `resource` parameter and proxies `authorize` and `token`. Requires `clientId`. |
| [`keycloak`]({{< link-hextra path="/integrations/auth/keycloak" >}}) | {issuer}/protocol/openid-connect/certs | OIDC discovery | Proxies DCR, because Keycloak sends CORS headers on its registration endpoint only for origins that you allow in a realm policy. |
| [`okta`]({{< link-hextra path="/integrations/auth/okta" >}}) `*` | {issuer}/.well-known/jwks.json | OIDC discovery | Appends the first audience to the authorization endpoint and proxies DCR to the org-level endpoint. Set `jwks` explicitly. |
| Not set | {issuer}/.well-known/jwks.json | RFC 8414 | Standards-compliant behavior with no provider-specific adaptations. |

`*` Okta publishes keys at `{issuer}/v1/keys`, not at the `{issuer}/.well-known/jwks.json` URL that agentgateway derives, so always set `jwks` explicitly. For more information, see the [Okta guide]({{< link-hextra path="/integrations/auth/okta" >}}).

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| audiences | List the accepted JWT `aud` values. Set at least one value to require a token whose `aud` claim matches one configured value. Omit `audiences` to disable audience validation. If you omit `audiences`, the MCP authentication validator does not require or compare the token's `aud` claim unless `jwtValidationOptions.requiredClaims` lists `aud`. |
| resourceMetadata | The metadata source is where agentgateway fetches the authorization server metadata that it serves to MCP clients. `RFC 8414` means the path-based `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/{path}` form. `OIDC discovery` means `{issuer}/.well-known/openid-configuration`, which these providers serve instead. Most of them do not implement the RFC 8414 path-based issuer format; Keycloak 26.4.0 and later do, but agentgateway keeps using OIDC discovery for it so that earlier versions work, too. |
| jwks | Set `jwks` to override that URL with a different endpoint, a local file, or an inline key set. If you omit `jwks`, agentgateway fetches keys from the derived URL for your provider.  |
| clientId | Setting `clientId` short-circuits DCR for every provider: agentgateway answers registration requests with that pre-registered client instead of proxying them to the authorization server. For `authentik` and `entra` this is the only way registration can succeed, because Entra has no registration endpoint and open source authentik does not implement RFC 7591. |
| clientSecret | Set `clientSecret` when your pre-registered client is a confidential client that the authorization server requires to authenticate at the token endpoint, such as an Entra app registration under the **Web** platform. Omit it for public, PKCE-only clients. Agentgateway injects the secret server-side into proxied token requests; MCP clients never supply it.
| matches | In routing-based configuration, the route must also match the `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/<path>` prefix so that agentgateway can serve the proxied metadata and the `authorize` and `token` endpoints. The simplified `mcp` form sets up those routes for you. |

### Adding an IdP

Adding support for a new provider requires minimal code changes. To contribute support for your identity provider, see the [`McpIDP` enum in the agentgateway source](https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/blob/main/crates/agentgateway/src/types/agent.rs).

## Authentication mode

You can control how agentgateway handles requests that lack valid credentials by setting the `mode` field. The following modes are supported:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `strict` (default) | A valid token issued by a configured issuer must be present. Requests without a valid token are rejected with `401 Unauthorized`. |
| `optional` | If a token is present, it is validated. Requests without a token are permitted. |
| `permissive` | Requests are never rejected based on authentication. |

The following example sets the mode to `permissive`:

```yaml
policies:
  mcpAuthentication:
    mode: permissive
    issuer: http://localhost:9000
    audiences: ["http://localhost:3000/mcp"]
    jwks:
      url: http://localhost:9000/.well-known/jwks.json
    resourceMetadata:
      resource: http://localhost:3000/mcp
      scopesSupported:
      - read:all
```

## JWT claim validation

By default, agentgateway requires the `exp` (expiration) claim to be present in every JWT. To change which claims are required, set the `jwtValidationOptions.requiredClaims` field. The following RFC 7519 registered claims are supported: `exp`, `nbf`, `aud`, `iss`, and `sub`. Any other claim name that you list, such as `iat` or a custom claim, is ignored and logged as a warning.

> [!NOTE]
> The `requiredClaims` field controls only whether a claim must be present. It does not control whether the claim's value is checked. The MCP authentication validator checks `exp`, `nbf`, and `iss` claim values when the token includes those claims. If you set `audiences`, the validator also compares the `aud` claim value against that list, whether or not you list `aud` in `requiredClaims`. If you omit `audiences`, the validator does not compare the `aud` value. Listing `aud` in `requiredClaims` only requires the claim to be present. For example, an expired token is rejected because it carries an `exp` claim, even if you omit `exp` from `requiredClaims`. The `sub` claim is checked for presence only, and custom claims are never validated by this field. To enforce the value of a custom claim, use an [authorization policy]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/configuration/security/mcp-authz" >}}) instead.

Some identity providers issue tokens without an `exp` claim. To accept those tokens, set `requiredClaims` to an empty list.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
mcp:
  port: 3000
  policies:
    mcpAuthentication:
      issuer: http://localhost:9000
      audiences: ["http://localhost:3000/mcp"]
      jwks:
        url: http://localhost:9000/.well-known/jwks.json
      jwtValidationOptions:
        requiredClaims: []

  targets:
  - name: tools
    stdio:
      cmd: npx
      args: ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything"]
```

To require additional claims, such as `aud` and `sub` alongside `exp`, list each one.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
mcp:
  port: 3000
  policies:
    mcpAuthentication:
      issuer: http://localhost:9000

      jwks:
        url: http://localhost:9000/.well-known/jwks.json
      jwtValidationOptions:
        requiredClaims:
        - exp
        - aud
        - sub

## Passthrough

When the MCP server already implements OAuth authentication, no additional configuration is needed. Agentgateway passes requests through without modification.
