Use LLM request transformations to dynamically compute and set fields in LLM requests using {{< gloss "CEL (Common Expression Language)" >}}Common Expression Language (CEL){{< /gloss >}} expressions. Transformations let you enforce policies such as capping token usage or conditionally modifying request parameters, without changing client code.

Use the following table to choose the field for what you want to change.

| To change | Use | Guide |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Fields in the LLM request body, by the names that the client sent | `transformation` | [Configure LLM request transformations](#configure-llm-request-transformations) |
| Fields in the LLM request body, by the names that the provider receives after agentgateway converts the request | `finalTransformation` | [Transform requests after provider conversion](#transform-requests-after-provider-conversion) |
| A header to a fixed value | `requestHeaders`, which needs no CEL | [Example: Set the Anthropic workspace header]({{< link-hextra path="/integrations/llm/providers/anthropic/#use-claude-platform-on-aws" >}}) |
| A header to a value that is computed from the incoming request | `requestTransformation` | [Modify the HTTP request to the provider](#llm-request-transformation) |
| The complete set of headers, the whole request body, or request metadata | `requestTransformation`, with `replace`, `body`, or `metadata` | [Modify the HTTP request to the provider](#llm-request-transformation) |

{{< doc-test paths="transformations" >}}
# ============================================================================
# Doc test coverage for this guide (these comments are not rendered on the page)
# ============================================================================
# WHAT THIS TEST VALIDATES:
#   * All three example configs are accepted by agentgateway (--validate-only), so
#     the `transformation` and `finalTransformation` fields and their CEL
#     expressions are correct.
#   * "Configure LLM request transformations": a client request that asks for 5000
#     max_tokens reaches the provider capped at 10.
#   * "Conditionally set fields based on headers": the same request reaches the
#     provider with 100 max_tokens as an admin user and 10 as a regular user.
#   * "Transform requests after provider conversion": a request that asks for 5000
#     max_tokens reaches the provider with max_completion_tokens capped at 10,
#     which only holds if the transformation ran AFTER the conversion renamed the
#     field. A pre-conversion transformation on max_completion_tokens would not
#     produce this result.
#
# HOW THE ASSERTIONS WORK:
#   The tests run against a local mock LLM instead of OpenAI, so no provider API
#   key is needed and no live completion is billed. The mock reports the
#   max_tokens value it received as usage.completion_tokens, so asserting on
#   completion_tokens asserts what agentgateway actually sent upstream - which is
#   what these transformations are documented to change.

## Configure LLM request transformations

1. Create a configuration file with your LLM transformation settings. The following example caps `max_tokens` to 10, regardless of what the client requests.
   ```yaml {paths="transformations"}
   cat <<'EOF' > config.yaml
   # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
   llm:
     models:
     - name: "*"
       provider: openAI
       params:
         apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
       transformation:
         max_tokens: "min(llmRequest.max_tokens, 10)"
   EOF
   ```

   | Setting | Description |
   | -- | -- |
   | `transformation` | A map of LLM request field names to CEL expressions. Each key is the field to set; each value is a CEL expression evaluated against the original request. Use the `llmRequest` variable to access the original LLM request body. |

   > [!NOTE]
   > Transformations take priority over `overrides` for the same field. If an expression fails to evaluate, the field is silently removed from the request.

2. Start agentgateway.
   ```sh
   agentgateway -f config.yaml
   ```

   {{< doc-test paths="transformations" >}}
   # Cap max_tokens: validate the documented config, then run it against the mock LLM.
   {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/point-config-at-mock-llm.md" >}}
   agentgateway -f config-mock.yaml &
   AGW_PID=$!
   trap 'kill $AGW_PID $MOCK_LLM_PID 2>/dev/null' EXIT
   sleep 3
   {{< /doc-test >}}

3. Send a request with `max_tokens` set to a value greater than 1024. The transformation caps it to 10 before the request reaches the LLM provider.
   ```sh {paths="transformations"}
   curl -s 'http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --data '{
     "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
     "max_tokens": 5000,
     "messages": [
       {
         "role": "user",
         "content": "Tell me a short story"
       }
     ]
   }' | jq .
   ```

   {{< doc-test paths="transformations" >}}
   YAMLTest -f - <<'EOF'
   - name: request with max_tokens transformation returns capped completion
     http:
       url: "http://localhost:4000"
       path: /v1/chat/completions
       method: POST
       headers:
         content-type: application/json
       body: |
         {
           "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
           "max_tokens": 5000,
           "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a short story"}]
         }
     source:
       type: local
     expect:
       statusCode: 200
       bodyJsonPath:
         - path: "$.usage.completion_tokens"
           comparator: equals
           value: 10
   EOF
   {{< /doc-test >}}

   Example output:
   ```console {hl_lines=[2]}
   {"model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125","usage":
   {"prompt_tokens":12,"completion_tokens":10,
   "total_tokens":22,"completion_tokens_details":
   {"reasoning_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0,
   "accepted_prediction_tokens":0,
   "rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":
   {"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0}},"choices":
   [{"message":{"content":"Once upon a time, in a quaint
   village nestled","role":"assistant","refusal":null,
   "annotations":[]},"index":0,"logprobs":null,
   "finish_reason":"length"}],
   "id":"chatcmpl-DHyGUsdgf2P5FidTbZIZFxdVGRfpq",
   "object":"chat.completion","created":1773175606,
   "service_tier":"default","system_fingerprint":null}%
   ```

   In the response, the `completion_tokens` value reflects a completion capped at 10 tokens.

## Conditionally set fields based on headers

Use a CEL expression in the model-level `transformation` field to dynamically set `max_tokens` based on the caller's identity from a request header. This example gives admin users a higher token limit than regular users.

```yaml {paths="transformations"}
cat <<'EOF' > config.yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config

llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: openAI
    params:
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
    transformation:
      max_tokens: "request.headers['x-user-id'] == 'admin' ? 100 : 10"
EOF
```

| Setting | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `transformation` | A map of LLM request field names to CEL expressions. Each key is the field to set; each value is a CEL expression evaluated against the original request. Use `request.headers` to access incoming HTTP headers and `llmRequest` to access the original LLM request body. |

{{< doc-test paths="transformations" >}}
# Header-conditional max_tokens: restart the gateway on the second config, again
# pointed at the mock LLM. This block must stay textually different from the
# restart block in the previous section: the extractor silently drops a block whose
# content is byte-identical to one it already selected, which would leave the
# assertions below running against the previous section's config.
kill $AGW_PID 2>/dev/null
sleep 1
{{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/point-config-at-mock-llm.md" >}}
agentgateway -f config-mock.yaml &
AGW_PID=$!
trap 'kill $AGW_PID $MOCK_LLM_PID 2>/dev/null' EXIT
sleep 3
{{< /doc-test >}}

If agentgateway is still running from the previous section, it reloads `config.yaml` automatically when you save the file. Otherwise, start agentgateway.

```sh
agentgateway -f config.yaml
```

Send a request as an admin user and verify the response uses the higher token limit.

```sh {paths="transformations"}
curl -s http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-user-id: admin" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a story"}]
  }' | jq .
```

Send a request as a regular user and verify the response is capped at the lower token limit.

```sh {paths="transformations"}
curl -s http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-user-id: alice" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a story"}]
  }' | jq .
```

{{< doc-test paths="transformations" >}}
YAMLTest -f - <<'EOF'
- name: admin user gets higher token limit
  http:
    url: "http://localhost:4000"
    path: /v1/chat/completions

        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a story"}]
      }
  source:
    type: local
  expect:
    statusCode: 200
    bodyJsonPath:
      - path: "$.usage.completion_tokens"

        comparator: equals
        value: 10

{{< /doc-test >}}

In the responses, the admin user receives up to 100 completion tokens while the regular user is capped at 10.

## Transform requests after provider conversion

The `transformation` field runs before agentgateway converts the request into the format that the provider expects. To write one, you must know how the conversion works, and you cannot change a field that the conversion itself adds.

The `finalTransformation` field runs after the conversion instead. You only need to know the shape of the target API.

The difference shows in the field names. When a client sends `max_tokens` to an OpenAI provider, the conversion renames the field to `max_completion_tokens`, so the provider receives the following request body.

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "max_completion_tokens": 5000,
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a short story"}]
}
```

A `transformation` entry must target `max_tokens`, the name that the client sent. A `finalTransformation` entry must target `max_completion_tokens`, the name that the provider receives.

1. Create a configuration file that caps the converted field and removes a field from the provider request. The `min()` expression caps `max_completion_tokens` at 10. The `fail("remove")` expression always fails to evaluate, which deletes `reasoning_effort` from the request.

   ```yaml {paths="transformations"}
   cat <<'EOF' > config.yaml
   # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
   llm:
     models:
     - name: "*"
       provider: openAI
       params:
         apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
       finalTransformation:
         max_completion_tokens: "min(llmRequest.max_completion_tokens, 10)"
         reasoning_effort: 'fail("remove")'
   EOF
   ```

   | Setting | Description |
   | -- | -- |
   | `finalTransformation` | A map of provider request field names to CEL expressions. Each key is the field to set in the converted request; each value is a CEL expression. Entries take priority over `overrides` for the same field. |

   > [!WARNING]
   > In a `finalTransformation` expression, `llmRequest` is the **converted** request body, not the request that the client sent. An expression that reads a field which the converted body does not have, such as `llmRequest.max_tokens` for an OpenAI provider, fails to evaluate. A failed expression removes the target field, so a mistyped field name silently deletes the field that you meant to set. For more information about the expression language, see the [CEL reference]({{< link-hextra path="/reference/cel/" >}}).

2. If agentgateway is still running from a previous section, it reloads `config.yaml` automatically when you save the file. Otherwise, start agentgateway.

   ```sh
   agentgateway -f config.yaml
   ```

   {{< doc-test paths="transformations" >}}
   # Post-conversion transformations: restart the gateway on the third config of this
   # guide, again pointed at the mock LLM. The comment differs from the two restart
   # blocks in the preceding sections on purpose: the extractor drops a block whose
   # content is byte-identical to one it already selected, which would leave the
   # assertion below running against the header-conditional config.
   kill $AGW_PID 2>/dev/null
   sleep 1
   {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/point-config-at-mock-llm.md" >}}
   agentgateway -f config-mock.yaml &
   AGW_PID=$!
   trap 'kill $AGW_PID $MOCK_LLM_PID 2>/dev/null' EXIT
   sleep 3
   {{< /doc-test >}}

3. Send a request that sets `max_tokens` and `reasoning_effort`. The conversion renames `max_tokens` to `max_completion_tokens`, and the transformation then caps that field at 10 and drops `reasoning_effort`.

   ```sh {paths="transformations"}
   curl -s 'http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --data '{
     "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
     "max_tokens": 5000,
     "reasoning_effort": "high",
     "messages": [
       {
         "role": "user",
         "content": "Tell me a short story"
       }
     ]
   }' | jq .
   ```

   {{< doc-test paths="transformations" >}}
   YAMLTest -f - <<'EOF'
   - name: post-conversion transformation caps the converted field
     http:
       url: "http://localhost:4000"
       path: /v1/chat/completions
       method: POST
       headers:
         content-type: application/json
       body: |
         {
           "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
           "max_tokens": 5000,
           "reasoning_effort": "high",
           "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a short story"}]
         }
     source:
       type: local
     expect:
       statusCode: 200
       bodyJsonPath:
         - path: "$.usage.completion_tokens"
           comparator: equals
           value: 10
   EOF
   {{< /doc-test >}}

   Example output:

   ```console {hl_lines=[2]}
   {"model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125","usage":
   {"prompt_tokens":12,"completion_tokens":10,
   "total_tokens":22},"choices":
   [{"message":{"content":"Once upon a time, in a quaint
   village nestled","role":"assistant"},"index":0,
   "finish_reason":"length"}],
   "id":"chatcmpl-DHyGUsdgf2P5FidTbZIZFxdVGRfpq",
   "object":"chat.completion","created":1773175606}%
   ```

   The `completion_tokens` value reflects a completion capped at 10 tokens, which confirms that the transformation reached the converted request.

## Modify the HTTP request to the provider {#llm-request-transformation}

Use `requestTransformation` to change the HTTP request that agentgateway sends to the provider, such as its headers or metadata. For a header with a fixed value, use `requestHeaders` instead, which needs no CEL.

1. Create a configuration file that selects an OpenAI project from a client header. The provider default sets the `openai-project` header based on the `x-team` request header, and removes `x-team` so that it is not sent to OpenAI. The `gpt-4o-batch` model sets its own `requestTransformation`, which replaces the provider default for that model.

   > [!WARNING]
   > Because a model-level `requestTransformation` replaces the provider default completely, the model loses every setting in the default, not only the ones it overrides. In the following example, `gpt-4o-batch` repeats `remove: [x-team]`. Without that line, requests to `gpt-4o-batch` would send the `x-team` header to OpenAI.

   ```yaml
   cat <<'EOF' > config.yaml
   # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
   llm:
     providers:
     - name: openai-prod
       provider: openAI
       params:
         apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
       defaults:
         requestTransformation:
           set:
             openai-project: '"x-team" in request.headers && request.headers["x-team"] == "research" ? "proj_research" : "proj_default"'
           remove:
           - x-team
     models:
     - name: gpt-4o
       provider:
         reference: openai-prod
       params:
         model: gpt-4o
     - name: gpt-4o-batch
       provider:
         reference: openai-prod
       params:
         model: gpt-4o-mini
       requestTransformation:
         set:
           openai-project: '"proj_batch"'
         remove:
         - x-team
   EOF
   ```

   | Setting | Description |
   | -- | -- |
   | `llm.providers[].defaults.requestTransformation` | The HTTP request transformation for every model that references the provider and does not set its own `requestTransformation`. |
   | `llm.models[].requestTransformation` | The HTTP request transformation for one model. If set, it replaces the provider default completely. The two are not merged. |
   | `set` | Headers to set. Each value is a CEL expression. To set a fixed string, quote the string inside the expression, such as `'"proj_batch"'`. |
   | `add` | Headers to append. Each value is a CEL expression. |
   | `remove` | Header names to remove. |
   | `replace` | A CEL expression that returns the complete set of headers. It is applied before `add`, `set`, and `remove`. |
   | `body` | A CEL expression that returns a replacement request body. |
   | `metadata` | Metadata values to add. Each value is a CEL expression. |

2. If agentgateway is still running from a previous section, it reloads `config.yaml` automatically when you save the file. Otherwise, start agentgateway.

   ```sh
   agentgateway -f config.yaml
   ```

### How `requestTransformation` interacts with other settings

* **When it runs**: `requestTransformation` runs before agentgateway converts the request to the provider format, and before `transformation` and `finalTransformation`. A replacement `body` therefore replaces the request that the client sent, and must still be a valid request for the client API. Agentgateway converts it afterward, as it does any other request.
* **CEL variables**: The expressions can read the HTTP request, such as `request.headers`. The `llmRequest` variable is not available. To read or set fields in the LLM request body, use `transformation` or `finalTransformation` instead.
* **`requestHeaders`**: `requestHeaders` runs after `requestTransformation`. If both set the same header, the `requestHeaders` value is sent.

## Available CEL variables

You can use these variables in your CEL transformation expressions.

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `request.headers["name"]` | Request header values | `request.headers["x-user-id"]` |
| `request.path` | Request path | `request.path` returns `/` |
| `request.method` | HTTP method | `request.method` returns `POST` |
| `llmRequest.max_tokens` | Original max_tokens from the request | `min(llmRequest.max_tokens, 100)` |
| `llmRequest.model` | Requested model name | `llmRequest.model` |

> [!NOTE]
> What `llmRequest` refers to depends on which field holds the expression. In a `transformation` entry, `llmRequest` is the request that the client sent. In a `finalTransformation` entry, `llmRequest` is the request after agentgateway converts it into the provider's format.

For a complete list of available variables and functions, see the [CEL reference documentation]({{< link-hextra path="/reference/cel/" >}}).

## Common transformation patterns

### Cap token usage

Enforce a maximum token limit regardless of what the client requests.

```yaml
llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: openAI
    params:
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
    transformation:
      max_tokens: "min(llmRequest.max_tokens, 1024)"
```

### Set temperature based on headers

Allow callers to control creativity through a header while enforcing bounds.

```yaml
llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: openAI
    params:
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
    transformation:
      temperature: "request.headers['x-creativity'] == 'high' ? 0.9 : 0.1"
```

### Combine multiple transformations

Apply several field-level transformations in a single configuration.

```yaml
llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: openAI
    params:
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
    transformation:
      max_tokens: "request.headers['x-user-tier'] == 'premium' ? 4096 : 256"
      temperature: "request.headers['x-user-tier'] == 'premium' ? 0.8 : 0.3"
```
