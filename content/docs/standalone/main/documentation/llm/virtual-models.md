# ============================================================================
# Doc test coverage for this guide (these comments are not rendered on the page)
# ============================================================================
# WHAT THIS TEST VALIDATES:
#   * The weighted, failover, and conditional example configs are accepted by agentgateway (--validate-only),
#     covering `llm.virtualModels[].routing.weighted.targets[].weight`,
#     `routing.failover.targets[].priority`, `llm.models[].health.eviction`,
#     and `routing.conditional.targets[].when`.
#   * "Public and internal models": with each config loaded, the served model list
#     contains the virtual model and any `visibility: public` model, and omits every
#     `visibility: internal` model. This turns the prose description of `public` and
#     `internal` into an observable assertion:
#       - weighted    -> gpt-4o-public, smart      (2 internal targets hidden)
#       - failover    -> resilient                 (all 3 targets are internal)
#       - conditional -> openai-public, adaptive   (2 internal targets hidden)
#     The failover case is the clearest: every target is internal, so only the
#     virtual entrypoint is exposed.
#
# WHAT THIS TEST DOES NOT VALIDATE (and why):
#   * That traffic is actually split 90/10 by `weight` - external dependency;
#     observing the split needs many live completions against OpenAI.
#   * That failover moves to a lower `priority` target after eviction removes
#     the primary, and that same-priority targets are load balanced by health
#     and latency - external dependency; triggering a real upstream failure
#     needs live providers.
#   * That `when` expressions select a target by request header - requires
#     config/traffic the page omits; the page shows no request example, and
#     confirming which internal target served a response needs a live provider
#     call.
{{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/install-agentgateway-binary.md" >}}
#   * That callout routing selects a target model: external dependency. The
#     callout example needs a running HTTP router service and live provider
#     calls.

# The example configs read API keys from the environment. --validate-only and the
# model listing still resolve env vars, so placeholders are enough here.

Virtual models let you publish one client-facing model name and route requests across one or more internal target models.

Use `llm.virtualModels[]` to define the virtual entrypoint and `llm.models[]` as the concrete upstream targets.

## Public and internal models

Use `llm.models[].visibility` to control whether a model is directly exposed to clients or kept as an internal target.

- `public`: The model can be requested directly by clients and can also be used as a virtual model target.
- `internal`: The model is intended for internal routing targets and is not exposed as a direct client model.

## Route selection modes

Each virtual model defines its routing strategy under `routing`.
The routing targets in a virtual model point to concrete `llm.models[]` entries.

### Weighted routing

Use `routing.weighted.targets` to split traffic between targets with `weight`.

```yaml
llm:
  models:
  - name: gpt-4o-public
    visibility: public
    provider: openAI
    params:
      model: gpt-4o
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
  - name: gpt-4o-primary
    visibility: internal
    provider: openAI
    params:
      model: gpt-4o
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
  - name: gpt-4o-fallback

### Failover routing

Use failover (also called automatic fallback) to keep serving when a primary model fails or becomes unavailable. Configure `routing.failover.targets` with `priority` on the virtual model. When a virtual model has more than one priority group, agentgateway enables default eviction for target models that do not set their own `health` policy, so unhealthy backends can leave the active set.

Failover has two levels of grouping:

- **Priority groups**: Targets with the same `priority` form one group. Lower priority values are preferred first. For example, priorities `0`, `0`, and `1` become `[[a, b], [c]]`.
- **Within a group**: Agentgateway load balances across targets by using a composite score of health and latency. Healthier, faster targets are favored.

Across priority groups, traffic moves to the next group only after every target in the current group is **evicted**. Lowering a health score alone is not enough to spill over to the next priority.

#### Health vs eviction

Configure health on the concrete `llm.models[]` entries that the virtual model targets (not on the virtual model itself).

| Setting | What it does |
| -- | -- |
| No `health` policy | The default unhealthy classifier covers `5xx` responses, non-zero gRPC statuses, and connection failures. When the virtual model has more than one priority group, these failures use default eviction: a single unhealthy response evicts the endpoint for `3s`, and each repeated eviction lasts longer. Traffic fails over to the next priority. |
| `health` without `eviction` | Setting `health` replaces the default eviction instead of adding to it. You can use `health.unhealthyExpression` to classify additional responses, such as `429`, as unhealthy. Without an `eviction` block, the endpoint is evicted only when a retry policy's `backoff`, or a `Retry-After` header on a response that is classified as unhealthy, supplies an eviction duration. To keep the default eviction settings, add `eviction: {}`. |
| `health.eviction` | Override how long an unhealthy endpoint leaves the active set, and which thresholds trigger eviction. When every endpoint in a priority group is evicted, later requests use the next priority. |

You do not need a `health` policy for basic failover on server errors or connection failures. To classify rate-limit responses, tune eviction timing, or change eviction thresholds, add a health policy that includes an `eviction` configuration.

Useful `health` fields:

- `unhealthyExpression`: Optional CEL expression; `true` marks the response unhealthy. When unset, any `5xx`, non-zero gRPC status, or connection failure is unhealthy.
- `eviction.duration`: Base time to keep an endpoint evicted. When you omit `duration`, agentgateway uses the `Retry-After` value from a 429 response, then the `backoff` from a retry policy, and then a default of `3s`. Repeated evictions use multiplicative backoff, with no upper bound.
- `eviction.consecutiveFailures`: Unhealthy responses required before eviction. When this and `healthThreshold` are both unset, a single unhealthy response can evict.
- `eviction.healthThreshold`: Evict when the endpoint health score (0.0–1.0) is below this value. Either this or `consecutiveFailures` can trigger eviction when both are set.
- `eviction.restoreHealth`: Optional health score (0.0–1.0) to apply when the endpoint returns from eviction.

Failover is driven by eviction of the active set, not by rewriting a single in-flight request to another target. The request that triggers eviction still fails unless you also configure retries so a later attempt can re-select a provider after eviction.

```yaml
llm:
  models:
  - name: claude-primary
    visibility: internal
    provider: anthropic
    params:
      model: claude-sonnet-4-0
      apiKey: "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
    health:
      eviction:
        consecutiveFailures: 1
        duration: 60s
  - name: claude-backup-a
    visibility: internal
    provider: anthropic
    params:
      model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
      apiKey: "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
    health:
      eviction:
        consecutiveFailures: 1
        duration: 60s
  - name: claude-backup-b
    visibility: internal
    provider: anthropic
    params:
      model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
      apiKey: "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
    health:
      eviction:
        consecutiveFailures: 1
        duration: 60s

  virtualModels:
  - name: resilient
    routing:
      failover:
        targets:
        - model: claude-primary
          priority: 0
        - model: claude-backup-a
          priority: 1
        - model: claude-backup-b
          priority: 1
```

In this example:

1. Requests prefer `claude-primary` (`priority: 0`).
2. After an unhealthy response meets the eviction thresholds, `claude-primary` is removed from the active set for `duration`.
3. Later requests fail over to the `priority: 1` group and load balance between `claude-backup-a` and `claude-backup-b` by health and latency.
4. Within that backup group, a degraded target is weighted down; the other backup continues to receive more traffic until the degraded target recovers or is also evicted.

```yaml
llm:
  models:
  - name: openai-public
    visibility: public
    provider: openAI
    params:
      model: gpt-4o-mini
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
  - name: openai-fast
    visibility: internal
    provider: openAI
    params:
      model: gpt-4o-mini
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
  - name: openai-smart
    visibility: internal
    provider: openAI
    params:
      model: gpt-4o
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"

  virtualModels:
  - name: adaptive
    routing:
      conditional:
        targets:
        - model: openai-fast
          when: request.headers["x-tier"] == "free"
        - model: openai-smart
          when: request.headers["x-tier"] == "pro"
```

{{< doc-test paths="virtual-models" >}}
cat <<'EOF' > config-conditional.yaml
llm:
  models:
  - name: openai-public
    visibility: public
    provider: openAI
    params:
      model: gpt-4o-mini
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
  - name: openai-fast
    visibility: internal
    provider: openAI
    params:
      model: gpt-4o-mini
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
  - name: openai-smart
    visibility: internal
    provider: openAI

      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"

  virtualModels:
  - name: adaptive
    routing:
      conditional:
        targets:
        - model: openai-fast
          when: request.headers["x-tier"] == "free"
        - model: openai-smart
          when: request.headers["x-tier"] == "pro"

### Callout routing

Use `routing.callout` to ask an external HTTP service which model to use for each request. Use this routing mode when routing depends on logic outside the gateway. For example, a model-selection service can score the prompt and return the best target.

The callout service returns a JSON response. The `transformation` expressions read the response from the `callout` CEL variable. The `model` expression must set `model` to one of the `llm.models[]` entries. Other transformation keys override fields in the request payload before the selected model receives the request.

```yaml
llm:
  models:
  - name: gpt-5.6-luna
    visibility: internal
    provider: openai
    params:
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
  - name: gpt-5.6-terra
    visibility: internal
    provider: openai
    params:
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"

  virtualModels:
  - name: auto
    routing:
      callout:
        host: http://127.0.0.1:8000/route
        body: '{"messages": llmRequest.messages}'
        transformation:
          model: callout.body.model
          reasoning_effort: callout.body.reasoning_effort
        failureMode:
          fallback: gpt-5.6-luna
        cache:
          key:
          - request.headers["x-session-id"]
          ttl: 10m
```

In this example, the client requests the `auto` virtual model. The gateway sends the request messages to the callout service. The gateway reads the selected model from `callout.body.model` and forwards the request to that model. The request falls back to `gpt-5.6-luna` if the callout fails, returns a non-2xx or non-JSON response, or selects an unknown model.

Use the following fields to configure callout routing:

| Field | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `routing.callout.host` | The HTTP service URL. The URL can include the path that receives the callout request. |
| `routing.callout.body` | Optional CEL expression that builds the callout request body. Strings and bytes are used directly. Other values are JSON-encoded. If you omit this field, the original request body is forwarded. |
| `routing.callout.headers` | Optional map of request headers to add to the callout request. Each value is a CEL expression. |
| `routing.callout.transformation` | CEL expressions that update fields in the LLM request after the callout returns. The `model` expression is required and selects the target from `llm.models[]`. |
| `routing.callout.failureMode.fallback` | Optional fallback model to use when the callout fails. If you omit `failureMode`, callout failures return `503` with the `virtual_model_callout_failed` error code. |
| `routing.callout.cache` | Optional cache for callout responses. On a cache hit, `transformation` is evaluated against the cached response. The cache `ttl` expression can read `callout` and is evaluated before `transformation` is applied. |
