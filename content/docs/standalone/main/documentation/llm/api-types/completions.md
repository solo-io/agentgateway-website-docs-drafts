The OpenAI Chat Completions API (`/v1/chat/completions`) is the primary interface for text generation and chat applications in agentgateway.

## About

The [OpenAI Chat Completions API](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/text) is the most widely used LLM endpoint. Agentgateway proxies these requests to your configured providers while providing token usage tracking, observability metrics, and policy enforcement.

## Route type configuration

In the simplified `llm` configuration, agentgateway automatically maps `/v1/chat/completions` requests to the `completions` route type, so no explicit route configuration is required.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: openAI
    params:
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

To configure the route type explicitly, use the `gateways` and `routes` format and set the `completions` route type in the `policies.ai.routes` map.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
gateways:
  default:
    port: 4000
routes:
- backends:
  - ai:
      name: openai
      provider:
        openAI: {}
  policies:
    ai:
      routes:
        "/v1/chat/completions": "completions"
    backendAuth:
      key: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

> [!NOTE]
> For detailed information about model routing and configuration modes, see [Model routing and aliases]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/about/" >}}).

## Reasoning carryover on a converted route

A Chat Completions request does not need a provider that speaks the OpenAI Chat Completions format. When the request is converted to the Anthropic Messages format on the way out, reasoning history is carried across turns, so a client that replays its own assistant messages keeps the model's prior reasoning.

On the way out, an assistant message that carries `reasoning_content` together with a non-empty `reasoning_signature` is replayed as a signed `thinking` block, placed ahead of its text and tool calls. An unsigned `reasoning_content` is left out, because the provider rejects a thinking block that has no signature.

On the way back, the signature of a response thinking block is forwarded as `reasoning_signature`, in both the buffered and the streamed response, so that the client has what it needs to replay the turn. When a buffered response holds more than one thinking block, the thinking text is joined into a single `reasoning_content` and no `reasoning_signature` is sent.

> [!NOTE]
> Send the signature back along with the reasoning. A client that keeps `reasoning_content` but discards `reasoning_signature` loses its thinking history on the next turn, with no error and no warning.

For the same behavior in the other direction, where a Messages client reaches a provider that speaks Chat Completions, see [Converting to the Chat Completions format]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/api-types/messages/#converting-to-the-chat-completions-format" >}}).

## Usage in converted replies

Chat Completions replies follow OpenAI usage conventions, even when agentgateway converts the upstream provider response from another format. When a provider reports prompt-cache tokens, `usage.prompt_tokens` includes those tokens. When they are available, cache counts are also reported separately in fields such as `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`, `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cache_write_tokens`, `usage.cache_read_input_tokens`, and `usage.cache_creation_input_tokens`.

## Using the API

Using the Chat Completions API works exactly the same as consuming OpenAI directly, with only a change to the base URL. This allows you to continue using existing code and SDKs.

> [!NOTE]
> The `api_key` parameter is required in the OpenAI library. Depending on your agentgateway configuration, it may or may not be required, and can be set to a mock value.

```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key="anything",
    base_url="http://localhost:4000/v1"

response = client.chat.completions.create(
