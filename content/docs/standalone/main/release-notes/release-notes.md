## ✨ Highlights {#v16-highlights}

Version 1.6 provides many updates to existing features, including the following quick highlights. Before you upgrade, review the [breaking changes](#v16-breaking-changes), because several defaults change.

- **[Sign-in improvements for the UI and your apps](#v16-security)**: OIDC sessions gain login and logout endpoints, answer `fetch` requests with `401` instead of a redirect, and fit more group claims into the session cookie.
- **[Cost tracking with no configuration](#v16-built-in-catalog)**: A built-in model catalog prices requests to common public models.
- **[More resilient LLM routing](#v16-llm)**: Failover evicts unhealthy targets automatically, and a new idle timeout catches backends that stall mid-stream.
- **[More complete MCP support](#v16-mcp)**: Paginated list responses, server information overrides, and SSE keep-alive for long-lived streams.

## 🔥 Breaking changes {#v16-breaking-changes}

### Anthropic Messages requests convert to the Responses format {#v16-messages-responses}

<!-- ref: https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/pull/3647 -->

Agentgateway now prefers the OpenAI Responses format when it converts Anthropic Messages requests. In 1.5, it preferred Chat Completions. This change applies to these providers:

- `openAI`, `ollama`, `groq`, `huggingface`, and `xai`
- `azure` for models other than Claude
- `custom` providers that declare both `responses` and `completions`

The Responses conversion drops extended-thinking history. The Chat Completions conversion preserves it.

**Actions to take**: Use the `openAI` provider only for the OpenAI API. For other OpenAI-compatible servers, use a `custom` provider with the formats that the server supports. If the server does not support `/v1/responses`, declare only `completions`. Also declare only `completions` if your clients need extended-thinking history.

Use `AGENTGATEWAY_MESSAGES_PREFER_COMPLETIONS=true` only to work around a Responses conversion bug with a provider that supports both formats. Set this environment variable on the agentgateway process. The variable is removed in 1.7. For more information, see [Provider format conversion]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/api-types/messages/#provider-format-conversion" >}}).

### Built-in model catalog for default request pricing {#v16-built-in-catalog}

<!-- ref: https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/pull/3191 -->
<!-- ref: https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/pull/3669 -->

Agentgateway now includes a built-in model cost catalog. Requests to common public models have a cost in logs, traces, metrics, and CEL without extra configuration. In 1.5, you had to configure a catalog to calculate costs. USD API key budgets and CEL expressions that use `llm.cost` now apply to these models.

**Actions to take**: Review your USD budgets and cost-based CEL expressions. If you already configure a catalog, you can remove that configuration. To customize rates, add an overlay to the built-in catalog. For more information, see [Configure a model catalog]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/cost-controls/costs/#configure-a-model-catalog" >}}).

### A `baseUrl` with no path sets the base path to `/` {#v16-baseurl-base-path}

<!-- ref: https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/pull/3403 -->

The `params.baseUrl` field of an `llm.models` entry now always sets the full base path. A URL with no path, such as `https://api.openai.com`, sets the base path to `/`. In 1.5, `custom` and `ollama` providers appended `/v1`. Built-in providers such as `openAI` forwarded the client's path.

**Actions to take**: Add the provider's API path to every `params.baseUrl` that has no path. For example, change `https://api.openai.com` to `https://api.openai.com/v1`. For Ollama, change `http://localhost:11434` to `http://localhost:11434/v1`. URLs that already have a path are unaffected. The change also does not affect `formats[].path` values or providers that use their default address.

### LLM serving paths must match exactly {#v16-llm-exact-paths}

<!-- ref: https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/pull/3539 -->

With the simplified `llm` configuration, agentgateway used to recognize a standard LLM path by its suffix, so a request to `/tenant-a/v1/messages` was handled as a Messages request. A standard path now must match exactly. A request to a prefixed path is forwarded to the provider as passthrough, without format conversion.

**Actions to take**: If your clients call the LLM paths under a base path, set `llm.pathPrefix` to that path, such as `pathPrefix: /tenant-a`. For more information, see [Model routing and aliases]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/about/#model-routing-and-aliases" >}}).

### The Helm chart requires `oidc.enabled` for OIDC {#v16-helm-oidc}

<!-- ref: https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/pull/3596 -->

The standalone Helm chart now sets the `OIDC_COOKIE_SECRET` environment variable only when the new `oidc.enabled` value is `true`. The value defaults to `false`.

**Actions to take**: If you set `oidc.cookieSecretName` to secure the UI or an app with OIDC, also set `oidc.enabled=true` when you upgrade. Otherwise, agentgateway rejects the OIDC configuration and does not start.

## ⚠️ Removed {#v16-removed}

<!-- ref: https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/pull/3208 -->

The `AGENTGATEWAY_LEGACY_LLM_USAGE_TOKEN_SEMANTICS` environment variable is removed. In 1.5, it restored the earlier token counts that left out cache tokens. In logs, metrics, and CEL, input and total token counts now always include cache tokens. The token usage that agentgateway returns to clients follows the API that the client calls instead. For more information, see [Other behavior changes](#v16-behavior-changes).

## 🔄 Other behavior changes {#v16-behavior-changes}

- **YAML configuration**: Unquoted values such as `no` stay strings instead of being interpreted as booleans. Use `true` or `false` for boolean settings. YAML configuration errors now include line numbers, and the UI preserves comments and formatting where possible when it writes the configuration file.
- **Backend authentication errors**: When agentgateway cannot get credentials from a provider, such as an OAuth token endpoint, AWS STS, or Azure, the request now fails with `502` instead of `500`. Local failures, such as a static key that cannot be set, return `500` instead of `503`.
- **Backend request timeout**: The `backendRequestTimeout` field of the `timeout` policy now also limits the time to read a buffered body. This limit applies to external authorization and CEL expressions that use `response.body`, for example. Streamed bodies are unaffected.
- **Access log level**: Request log records now use `error` when agentgateway records a request error, and `info` otherwise. In 1.5, all request records used `info`.
- **Guardrail results**: The `guardrails` CEL variable now has an entry for every guard that ran, including a new `allow` action. To find interventions only, filter on `action != "allow"`.
- **Failover eviction**: A virtual model with more than one priority group now evicts a failing target by default. A `health` policy replaces this default. To keep failover, include `health.eviction` in each `llm.models` entry where you configure a health policy. For more information, see [Health vs. eviction]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/virtual-models/#health-vs-eviction" >}}).
- **Model catalog refresh**: The **Refresh base costs** button in the UI now downloads the agentgateway model catalog, which tracks the `main` branch of the agentgateway repository, instead of the models.dev catalog. The catalog on `main` can gain fields after this release. So that a refresh keeps working, agentgateway ignores catalog fields that it does not recognize, and drops any pricing tier with a condition that it cannot apply. For more information, see [Import costs (UI)]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/cost-controls/costs/#import-costs-ui" >}}).
- **Token usage in responses**: The `usage` that agentgateway returns to clients now follows the conventions of the API that the client calls, whichever provider serves the request. Anthropic Messages responses leave cache tokens out of `input_tokens` and report them in `cache_read_input_tokens` and `cache_creation_input_tokens`. OpenAI Chat Completions and Responses include cache tokens in the input and total token counts. For example, a Chat Completions request to an Anthropic or Amazon Bedrock model that writes to the prompt cache now reports those cache tokens in `prompt_tokens`. If a client calculates usage or cost from these fields, review its counts after you upgrade.
- **Policy service timeouts**: Calls to external services default to a timeout of 2 seconds for gRPC external authorization and 10 seconds for rate limit and external processing services.
- **Streaming guardrails**: Agentgateway now rejects content if a provider guard fails while checking a streamed response or realtime connection. To keep the 1.5 behavior, set `failureMode: failOpen` on the guard. For example, set it in `ai.promptGuard.response[].bedrockGuardrails`. For more information, see [Provider failures]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/prompt-guards/overview/#provider-failures" >}}).

- **Meta provider**: Use `provider: meta` to connect to the Meta Model API with built-in defaults for Chat Completions, Messages, and Responses. For more information, see [Meta]({{< link-hextra path="/integrations/llm/providers/meta/" >}}).
- **Wildcard models in `/v1/models`**: For wildcard names in `llm.models`, `/v1/models` lists matching model IDs from the catalog. For example, `*` for the OpenAI provider expands to IDs such as `gpt-4o`. To list the pattern as in 1.5, set `llm.discovery: disabled`. For more information, see [Wildcard expansion]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/api-types/models/#wildcard-expansion" >}}).
- **Response idle timeout**: A response idle timeout ends a response if the backend stops sending body data for the configured time. It does not limit the duration of an active stream. Set `responseIdleTimeout` in the `timeout` policy. You can now also set the `timeout` policy in `llm.policies`. For more information, see [Route timeouts]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/configuration/resiliency/timeouts/#route-timeouts" >}}).
- **Larger LLM buffer**: LLM requests can now buffer up to 32 MiB by default, up from 2 MiB. The larger buffer supports long-context prompts. To change the limit, set `frontendPolicies.http.maxBufferSize`. For more information, see [Body buffering]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/configuration/traffic-management/buffer/" >}}).
- **Per-page pricing**: To price OCR and document models that bill per processed page, set `rates.perPage` in the model's cost catalog entry. For more information, see [Model costs]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/cost-controls/costs/#advanced-catalog-format" >}}).
- **Bedrock Mantle routing**: The Bedrock provider chooses the Runtime or Mantle endpoint for each model. To set the preference, use `params.bedrockEndpointPreference` on an `llm.models` entry, or set it in the UI. For more information, see [Bedrock Mantle]({{< link-hextra path="/integrations/llm/providers/bedrock/#bedrock-mantle" >}}).
- **More accurate Messages conversion**: Conversion between the Messages and OpenAI formats now carries citations, refusals, the `strict` setting of tool schemas, reasoning effort, and images in tool results. A context overflow error from the provider is translated so that Claude Code can compact and retry. For more information, see [Converted replies and errors]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/api-types/messages/#converted-replies-and-errors" >}}).
- **Guardrails**: Provider guards in `ai.promptGuard` or `llm.policies.guardrails` now support `failureMode`. Webhook guards support `target.policies` to configure the webhook connection. The built-in credit card pattern now checks the Luhn checksum. For more information, see [Provider failures]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/prompt-guards/overview/#provider-failures" >}}) and the [JEV integration]({{< link-hextra path="/integrations/llm/guardrails/jev/" >}}).

### Security {#v16-security}

<!-- ref: https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/pull/3540 -->

- **OIDC sign-in**: An OIDC policy can serve login and logout endpoints. The UI sets both automatically. A `fetch` request without a session now gets `401` instead of a redirect to the identity provider. Session cookies now use compression so that users with many groups can sign in. For more information, see [OIDC]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/configuration/security/oidc/" >}}).
- **OIDC session refresh**: Agentgateway automatically uses a refresh token from the identity provider to renew an expired browser session. The refreshed ID token must identify the same user; a missing ID token or a different `sub` requires sign-in again. Add `offline_access` when your provider requires that scope to issue refresh tokens. For more information, see [Session cookies]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/configuration/security/oidc/#session-cookies" >}}).
- **Hashed API keys in the UI**: The UI stores new API keys as hashes by default.
- **JWT validation**: With several JWT providers, agentgateway tries each provider whose `issuer` and JWKS key ID match the token. Agentgateway also checks the `nbf` (not before) claim to reject tokens that are not yet valid. This check allows 60 seconds of leeway for clock skew. The `audiences` field of the `mcpAuthentication` route policy is now optional. For more information, see [MCP authentication]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/configuration/security/mcp-authn/#jwt-claim-validation" >}}).
- **Backend authentication**: In the `backendAuth` policy or the `auth` field of an `llm.models` entry, AWS `assumeRole` takes an `externalId`, and Azure authentication takes `scopes`. For more information, see [AWS]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/configuration/security/backend-authn/providers/aws/#assume-a-role" >}}) and [Azure]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/configuration/security/backend-authn/providers/azure/#configure-token-scopes" >}}).
- **Network authorization by destination**: Rules in `frontendPolicies.networkAuthorization` can match on `destination.address`, `destination.port`, and the TLS SNI hostname in `destination.hostname`. For more information, see [Require TLS SNI]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/configuration/security/network-authz/#require-tls-sni" >}}).

- **Conditional virtual MCP targets**: Set `mcp.targets[].condition` to a CEL expression to select which targets participate in a request before agentgateway initializes or contacts them. Conditions require at least two configured targets. For more information, see [Target conditions]({{< link-hextra path="/integrations/mcp/servers/virtual/#target-conditions" >}}).
- **List pagination**: List responses for tools, prompts, and resources carry a `nextCursor`. When an endpoint federates several targets, the client gets one combined cursor that tracks every target. For more information, see [List pagination]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/mcp/spec-compatibility/#list-pagination" >}}).
- **MCP fields in CEL**: Access logs can record list results, such as `mcp.toolsList`, and authorization rules can match on `mcp.methodName`. For more information, see [MCP logging fields]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/mcp/mcp-observability/#mcp-logging-fields" >}}) and [CEL variables]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/configuration/security/mcp-authz/#cel-variables" >}}).
- **Server information overrides**: An `mcp.server` block replaces the `serverInfo` and instructions that a multiplexed gateway reports. For more information, see [Server information overrides]({{< link-hextra path="/integrations/mcp/servers/virtual/#server-information-overrides" >}}).
- **SSE keep-alive**: `mcp.sseKeepAlive` sends periodic comments on long-lived MCP streams so that idle proxies do not close them. For more information, see [SSE keep-alive]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/mcp/configuration-modes/#sse-keep-alive" >}}).
- **Request size limit**: An MCP request body that is larger than the buffer limit returns `413`. For more information, see [MCP request body limits]({{< link-hextra path="/integrations/mcp/servers/http/#mcp-request-body-limits" >}}).

<!-- ref: https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/pull/3319 -->
<!-- ref: https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/pull/3259 -->

- **Per-key local rate limits**: A `localRateLimit` entry takes a CEL `key` that gives each value, such as a user or API key, its own bucket. For more information, see [Per-key limits]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/configuration/resiliency/rate-limits/#per-key" >}}).
- **External processing**: Set `extProc.failureMode: failOpen` in a route's `policies` section to forward requests when the processing server fails. Agentgateway now also forwards the request body if the processing server fails before agentgateway sends any body bytes to it. For more information, see [Failure modes]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/configuration/traffic-management/extproc/#failure-modes" >}}).
- **Graceful drain**: During shutdown, agentgateway stops accepting new connections after `config.connectionMinTerminationDeadline`. It continues to serve open connections until `config.connectionTerminationDeadline`. For more information, see [Shutdown and drain]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/configuration/static-configuration/#shutdown-drain" >}}).
- **Helm chart scaling**: The standalone chart can create a PodDisruptionBudget and a HorizontalPodAutoscaler. For more information, see [Create a PodDisruptionBudget]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/setup/install/helm/#helm-pdb" >}}).
- **Telemetry**: OTLP access logs use the `agentgateway.access` instrumentation scope. The request duration metric records failed requests with an `error_type` label. For the metrics, see the [metrics reference]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/observability/metrics/reference/#llm" >}}).

### OpenTelemetry field names {#v16-otel-attributes}

<!-- ref: https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/pull/3182 -->

You can now opt in to OpenTelemetry field names for stdout access logs. Set `frontendPolicies.accessLog.preset: otel`. For more information, see [Use OpenTelemetry field names]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/observability/access-logs/view/#preset" >}}).

## 🐛 Fixes {#v16-fixes}

**Traffic management**

- Connections with `maxConnectionDuration` close with up to 10% jitter, which reduces synchronized reconnects at the configured connection age.
- Bare backend references in standalone HTTP routes, TCP routes, and MCP target backend hosts now resolve to top-level backends. A reference such as `backend: upstream` no longer fails at request time with `service not found` when the top-level backend is named `upstream`.
- Route path regexes now use full-path matching consistently, including patterns with alternation or lazy quantifiers.

**LLM**

- Vertex AI catalog lookups resolve Anthropic model aliases such as `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5@20250929`, and `publishers/anthropic/models/claude-sonnet-4-5@20250929`.
- Bedrock Messages conversion keeps prompt-cache markers from dropped unsupported content blocks by moving the cache point to supported content.

**MCP**

- Access-log CEL expressions can now read dynamic metadata that ExtMCP request-phase guardrails return through `mcpGuardrails`, including on resumed stateful MCP sessions. For more information, see [Log MCP guardrail metadata]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/observability/access-logs/view/#mcp-guardrails" >}}).
- OpenAPI MCP tools return `image/*` responses as MCP image content instead of UTF-8-decoded text.

**Operations**

- Standalone Helm installs can set `podDisruptionBudget.maxUnavailable` without also rendering the default `podDisruptionBudget.minAvailable` value.
