Configure Amazon Bedrock as an LLM provider in agentgateway.

> [!NOTE]
> Bedrock excludes cached tokens from the input count that it reports. The CEL field `llm.inputTokens` adds them back, so telemetry, metrics, and token-based limits count a cache-heavy request higher than the number that Bedrock reports. To read the Bedrock number itself, use `llm.providerInputTokens`. For more information, see [Token usage fields]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/observability/#token-usage-fields" >}}).

# ============================================================================
# Doc test coverage for this guide (these comments are not rendered on the page)
# ============================================================================
# WHAT THIS TEST VALIDATES:
#   * "Configuration": the example config is accepted by agentgateway
#     (--validate-only), so `provider: bedrock` is recognized and
#     `params.awsRegion` is correct.
#   * "Passthrough": the `passthrough: detect` config is accepted, including the
#     `name: us.anthropic*` prefix match.
#   * "Bedrock Mantle": the `params.bedrockEndpointPreference` config is
#     accepted, which pins both the field name and the lowercase spelling of the
#     value. Standalone rejects the capitalized Kubernetes spelling, so this
#     block is what keeps the two modes from being copied into each other.
#   * With the base config loaded, agentgateway serves the wildcard model and
#     resolves it to the `bedrock` provider in the configured AWS region.
#
# WHAT THIS TEST DOES NOT VALIDATE (and why):
#   * "Authentication" - external dependency; AWS credentials are resolved per
#     request from the ambient environment, which the test cannot provide.
#   * The Converse and Invoke boto3 examples - display-only Python snippets that
#     need real AWS credentials and a Bedrock model grant.
#   * "Token counting", "Extended thinking and reasoning", and "Structured
#     outputs" - external dependency; each bills a live Bedrock completion. Their
#     example responses and the `reasoning_effort` budget table are display-only.
#   * That format translation to Bedrock's Converse API is correct - a different
#     layer; verifying the translation needs a live Bedrock upstream.
#   * Which endpoint a given model actually resolves to under
#     `bedrockEndpointPreference` - external dependency; the resolution reads
#     `runtime`/`mantle` tags from an imported catalog, and populating that
#     catalog calls the AWS model-card pages.

> [!NOTE]
> Agentgateway accepts requests in one of the supported [API formats]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/api-types/" >}}) (such as the `/v1/chat/completions` request body shape) and returns responses in that format.
> Agentgateway translates between these formats and Bedrock formats internally using Bedrock's [Converse API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference-call.html).
> Directly sending `Converse` or `Invoke` request shapes are not directly supported; see [passthrough](#passthrough) for more information if you need these APIs.

## Authentication

Before you can use Bedrock as an LLM provider, you must authenticate by using the standard [AWS authentication sources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/creds-config-files.html).
Agentgateway will automatically detect the local ambient credentials, but these can be explicitly configured with `auth.aws`.

## Configuration

{{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/review-configuration.md" >}}

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config

llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: bedrock
    params:
      awsRegion: us-west-2
```

{{< doc-test paths="bedrock" >}}
cat <<'EOF' > config.yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config

llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: bedrock
    params:
      awsRegion: us-west-2
EOF
agentgateway -f config.yaml --validate-only
{{< /doc-test >}}

{{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/review-configuration.md" >}}

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `name` | The model name to match in incoming requests. When a client sends `"model": "<name>"`, the request is routed to this provider. Use `*` to match any model name. |
| `provider` | The LLM provider, set to `bedrock` for Amazon Bedrock models. |
| `params.model` | The specific Bedrock model to use. If set, this model is used for all requests. If not set, the request must include the model to use. |
| `params.awsRegion` | The AWS region where the Bedrock model is hosted. |

## Passthrough

If your applications directly use the AWS `Converse` or `Invoke` APIs, Agentgateway cannot translate these APIs to other providers.
However, it can pass the request through to Bedrock itself following the [passthrough]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/api-types/passthrough/" >}}) approach.

This can provide telemetry data for these requests.

First, setup passthrough mode:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
llm:
  models:
  - name: us.anthropic*
    provider: bedrock
    params:
      awsRegion: us-west-2
    passthrough: detect
```

{{< doc-test paths="bedrock" >}}
cat <<'EOF' > config-passthrough.yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config
llm:
  models:
  - name: us.anthropic*
    provider: bedrock
    params:
      awsRegion: us-west-2
    passthrough: detect
EOF
agentgateway -f config-passthrough.yaml --validate-only
{{< /doc-test >}}

Then, you can send native Converse and Invoke requests:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Converse" %}}

```python
import json

import boto3

client = boto3.client(
    'bedrock-runtime',
    region_name='us-west-2',
    endpoint_url='http://localhost:4000',
)
response = client.converse(
    modelId='us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6',
    messages=[
        {
            'role': 'user',
            'content': [{'text': 'give 1 word answer'}]
        }
    ]
)
print('converse response:')
print(response)
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Invoke" %}}

```python
import json

import boto3

client = boto3.client(
    'bedrock-runtime',
    region_name='us-west-2',
    endpoint_url='http://localhost:4000',
)
response = client.invoke_model(
    modelId='us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6',
    body=json.dumps({
        'anthropic_version': 'bedrock-2023-05-31',
        'max_tokens': 10,
        'messages': [
            {
                'role': 'user',
                'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'give 1 word answer'}],
            }
        ],
    }),
)
body = json.loads(response['body'].read())

print('invoke response:')
print(body)
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}


> [!NOTE]
> Model translations are not supported with passthrough, so avoid using a model match like `aws/*`, as it cannot be transformed.

## Claude Platform on AWS

See [here](../anthropic/#use-claude-platform-on-aws) for connect to [Claude Platform on AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/claude-platform/latest/userguide/welcome.html).

## Bedrock Mantle

Bedrock serves models on two API surfaces: the Runtime endpoint, which carries the Converse and Invoke APIs, and the [Mantle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/bedrock-mantle.html) endpoint, which carries the native OpenAI and Anthropic APIs. Some models are served on only one of the two.

For chat requests, the endpoint is chosen per model from the `runtime` and `mantle` tags in your [model cost catalog]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/cost-controls/costs/" >}}). Run `agctl catalog import` to populate those tags, because the default sources include `aws-bedrock-mantle`, which reads them from the AWS model cards. Without a catalog, no model carries either tag, so every chat request falls back to the preference alone.

Set `params.bedrockEndpointPreference` to choose how the tags are applied.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config

llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: bedrock
    params:
      awsRegion: us-west-2
      bedrockEndpointPreference: runtimePreferred
```

{{< doc-test paths="bedrock" >}}
cat <<'EOF' > config-mantle.yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config

llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: bedrock
    params:
      awsRegion: us-west-2
      bedrockEndpointPreference: runtimePreferred
EOF
agentgateway -f config-mantle.yaml --validate-only
{{< /doc-test >}}

| Value | Endpoint selection |
|-------|--------------------|
| `runtimePreferred` | Use Runtime, except for a model tagged `mantle` but not `runtime`. This value is the default. |
| `mantlePreferred` | Use Mantle, except for a model tagged `runtime` but not `mantle`. |
| `runtimeOnly` | Always use Runtime, whatever the tags say. |
| `mantleOnly` | Always use Mantle, whatever the tags say. |

The Kubernetes API takes the same four values capitalized, such as `RuntimePreferred`, under `spec.ai.provider.bedrock.endpointPreference`. A value that you copy from one mode to the other fails to load.

The preference applies to four route types: chat completions, messages, responses, and Anthropic token counting. Every other route type ignores the preference and uses a fixed endpoint.

- Model listing always uses Mantle.
- Embeddings, realtime, Gemini token counting, detection, passthrough, and content generation always use Runtime.
- Reranking uses a separate Bedrock agent-runtime host rather than the Runtime or Mantle endpoint.

Whether the preference changes the request format that a model accepts depends on the endpoint that it selects. A model that resolves to Runtime accepts the Bedrock Converse format only, and its chat format tags do not apply. A model that resolves to Mantle accepts the formats in its tags, except for `anthropic.claude*` models, which always take the Anthropic Messages format. For more information, see [Chat format tags]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/cost-controls/costs/#chat-format-tags" >}}).

> [!NOTE]
> Requests to the Mantle endpoint are signed for the `bedrock-mantle` service rather than `bedrock`. If you scope an IAM policy by service name, grant both before you switch a route to Mantle.

## Token counting

Bedrock supports token counting for Anthropic models via the `count_tokens` endpoint.
Agentgateway automatically handles the required formatting for Bedrock's count-tokens endpoint.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/v1/messages/count_tokens \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    "system": "You are a helpful assistant."
  }'
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "input_tokens": 15
}
```

## Extended thinking and reasoning

Extended thinking and reasoning lets models reason through complex problems before generating a response. You can opt in to extended thinking and reasoning by adding specific parameters to your request. Agentgateway maps these parameters to Bedrock's native format automatically.

> [!NOTE]
> Extended thinking and reasoning requires a Claude model that supports it, such as `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-20250514-v1:0`.

Use the `reasoning_effort` field to control how much reasoning the model applies. The value is automatically mapped to a thinking budget.

| `reasoning_effort` value | Thinking budget |
|---|---|
| `minimal` or `low` | 1,024 tokens |
| `medium` | 2,048 tokens |
| `high` or `xhigh` | 4,096 tokens |

Note that `max_tokens` must be greater than the thinking budget, and the minimum thinking budget is 1,024 tokens.

### Encrypted reasoning responses {#encrypted-reasoning-responses}

Some Bedrock models return encrypted reasoning in a `reasoningContent.redactedContent` block. When a non-streaming response contains this block, the request can complete instead of failing when Bedrock withholds the reasoning text.

For `/v1/chat/completions`, encrypted reasoning is omitted from the response because the API has no encrypted-reasoning field. Signed text reasoning still uses `reasoning_content` and `reasoning_signature` when Bedrock sends them.

For `/v1/responses`, encrypted reasoning is returned as a reasoning item with `encrypted_content`. When the client sends that reasoning item in the next request, the next Bedrock request includes `reasoningContent.redactedContent`.

For `/v1/messages`, encrypted reasoning is returned as a `redacted_thinking` block. When the client sends that block in the next request, the next Bedrock request includes `reasoningContent.redactedContent`.

```sh
curl "localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions" -H content-type:application/json -d '{
  "model": "",
  "max_tokens": 6000,
  "reasoning_effort": "high",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Explain the trade-offs between consistency and availability in distributed systems."
    }
  ]
}' | jq
```

## Structured outputs

Structured outputs constrain the model to respond with a specific JSON schema. Provide the schema definition in the OpenAI `response_format` field of your request. Agentgateway translates this to Bedrock's native format automatically.

```sh
curl "localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions" -H content-type:application/json -d '{
  "model": "",
  "max_tokens": 256,
  "response_format": {
    "type": "json_schema",
    "json_schema": {
      "name": "answer_schema",
      "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "answer": { "type": "string" },
          "confidence": { "type": "number" }
        },
        "required": ["answer", "confidence"],
        "additionalProperties": false
      }
    }
  },
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Is the sky blue? Respond with your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1."
    }
  ]
}' | jq
```
