Configure OpenAI as an LLM provider in agentgateway.

# ============================================================================
# Doc test coverage for this guide (these comments are not rendered on the page)
# ============================================================================
# WHAT THIS TEST VALIDATES:
#   * "Configuration": the example config is accepted by agentgateway
#     (--validate-only), so `provider: openAI` is a recognized provider and the
#     `name` / `params.apiKey` fields are correct.
#   * With the config loaded, agentgateway serves the wildcard model from the
#     example and resolves it to the `openAI` provider, which is what the `name`
#     and `provider` rows of the settings table describe.
#
# WHAT THIS TEST DOES NOT VALIDATE (and why):
#   * "Example request" and any example responses - external dependency; the
#     request needs a real OpenAI API key and bills a live completion, so the test
#     uses a placeholder key.
#   * `params.model` - display-only table row; the example config omits it, so
#     there is nothing on this page to run.

# The example config reads the API key from the environment. --validate-only
# and the config dump still resolve env vars, so a placeholder is enough here.

## Configuration

{{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/review-configuration.md" >}}

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config

llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: openAI
    params:
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

{{< doc-test paths="openai" >}}
cat <<'EOF' > config.yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://agentgateway.dev/schema/config

llm:
  models:
  - name: "*"
    provider: openAI
    params:
      apiKey: "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
EOF
agentgateway -f config.yaml --validate-only

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `name` | The model name to match in incoming requests. When a client sends `"model": "<name>"`, the request is routed to this provider. Use `*` to match any model name. |
| `provider` | The LLM provider, set to `openAI` for OpenAI models. |
| `params.model` | The specific OpenAI model to use. If set, this model is used for all requests. If not set, the request must include the model to use. |
| `params.apiKey` | The OpenAI API key for authentication. You can reference environment variables using the `$VAR_NAME` syntax. |

With the OpenAI provider, you can send OpenAI Decisions API requests to `/v1/decisions`. When the response includes OpenAI usage fields, LLM telemetry records the model and token usage.

> [!NOTE]
> For advanced routing scenarios that require path-based routing or custom endpoints, use the `gateways` and `routes` configuration format. See the [Routing-based configuration guide]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/llm/configuration-modes/" >}}) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> To connect Codex to agentgateway, see the [Codex integration page]({{< link-hextra path="/integrations/llm/clients/codex" >}}).
